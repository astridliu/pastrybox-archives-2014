Once upon a time, I used to look for advice for every professional decision I took. Should I submit to this
CfP? Write for that outlet? Or pursue a particular opportunity? Many people offered me their best advice, and
for the most part, I took it.

Over time, I find that I ask for advice less and less. It’s not that I don’t need the input of other
people any more; rather that I know whose advice I would ask, and I know those people well. I can think about
the conversation I would have with a particular mentor, and fill in his or her side of the story without
needing them to cheerlead me along those same, well-trodden paths. Those people gave me specific advice when I
asked, but they have also given me something much more valuable: the ability to be my own guide.

The circle goes on, and now people come to me for advice. However I advise them, I always try to pay forward
the same gift and help them to work out for themselves what their best path will be.
