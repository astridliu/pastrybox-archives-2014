When I was 16, I started to learn how to play guitar. Though when I say play, it was more like hit it vaguely
in time, coated with distortion. Once that phase had passed and I could string together a few power chords, I
started to wonder how people wrote songs. I’d stop by a newsagent on the way to college and buy a guitar
magazine with the little money I had, mainly for the tablature to help learn more songs. Alongside the few
tracks they had transcribed, there’d be interviews; often too ‘muso’ for me but I remembered reading one
with Mike McCready of Pearl Jam.

McCready talked about how wherever he went, on tour or wherever, he carted around a 4 track or some way to
record an idea. Over time, he’d stockpile riffs, melodies, jams and maybe they’d come in handy someday or
he’d be able to spot patterns or some way his playing was evolving.

Being a metal/grunge kid at the time, I’d watch VHS tapes bands I liked churned out. ‘A Year and a Half in
the Life of Metallica’ showed how James Hetfield would do something similar, sometimes while driving, just
hum a riff, tap the steering wheel for a beat or sing if a melody came to mind.

There are loads of ways to sketch, and this way of sketching with music stuck with me from that time. I have a
band and try to write all the time. It’s a hobby. Some are badly recorded humming, some aren’t far off
complete songs, most have a verse, a chorus or at least a melody that could be worked on. More than the
recordings themselves, more than the expression of an idea, it’s the process of creating that I love about
this more than anything. Wherever I am, it’s something I can do to briefly step out of what I’m involved
in at the time and capture that spark.

One thing that took a while to get to was letting stuff just come out. Instead of preemptively judging an
idea, try and give it some time, record it and try to listen back later with a fresh point of view. Sometimes
your instinct may be right, sometimes you can surprise yourself. After almost giving myself the freedom to
just create, I kind of felt that burden to somehow be in line with how I perceived what my music should sound
like lifted. I have this view that I don’t like music I perceive to be cheesy so I’d steer away from ideas
that felt at all like that. Over time, letting down that guard meant playing about with different vocal
techniques, trying out different beats or instruments.

While I draw far less than I used to, I saw a similar thing when trying to get started again with paper.
I’ve always drawn superheroes and little cartoon heads but trying to forget about I’ve always done and
just draw — maybe stuff around me or the first thing that popped into my head — made it fun again. I
didn’t try to draw to achieve a specific thing, just for the love of it and that changed how I saw it
entirely.

Whether it’s with pencil & paper or humming into the voice memo app of your phone or something more
elaborate. Capture those sparks when they happen. Even if you never go back to them, it’s the process. Keep
a part of you creative in something outside of your main focus.
