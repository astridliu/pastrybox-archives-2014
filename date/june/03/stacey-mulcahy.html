       <p>Recent Conversation:</p><p>“Do you have any kids?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. There is lots of time for you to find someone and start a family still”.&nbsp;</p><p>Or another variation:</p><p>“I am sure she wouldn’t mind putting in the extra time because she doesn’t have a family”.&nbsp;</p><p>FULL STOP.&nbsp;</p><p>What? I mean, what?&nbsp;</p><p>I do not have kids. Some might call me barren. Some might call me a spinster. No one calls me a cat lady, not yet, at least not to my face in daylight because they are kind and smart individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone makes the assumption that I want what they want — what society wants. When these things are said, they assume that the only family worth having is one that you spent hours pushing out. People assume I can have what they have. They assume I want what they want. Maybe my parts are completely busted and broken. Maybe I have spent years trying, or spent years trying to adopt. Maybe I am just not interested. Maybe I am more than enough of a child to consider dealing with any more.</p><p>The definition of family and having one is too tightly tied to procreation. I have a family. Some are relatives and they are mine whether I like them or not. Some are amazing people that I’ve been lucky to consider good friends. I would do anything for these people. I am there for the good moments and there for the bad. I watch them grow and see myself growing alongside of them.They are my family and I didn’t push them out of anything, I just keep them near to everything.</p><p>Nothing is worse than the assumption that I am less than you just because I don’t have what you have or want what you want. Our families might define us, but we need to re-define them.&nbsp;</p>
