I occasionally work from the neighborhood Starbucks. Normally I keep my earbuds in and my eyes fixed on the
screen. But one day, a man with whom I’d exchanged pleasantries in the past walked up to my table and said,
“Let me talk to you.” He grabbed an empty chair and sat down across from me before I could respond. So I
took out my earbuds and closed my computer. This guy wanted to talk. 

It was amazing. 

He goes by Wolf. I heard about how he fought in the war in Bosnia, how he was put in charge of handling
journalists who were covering the war, and how he met his wife (she was one of those journalists!). He moved
here at age 42 to marry her, and he brought along his two teenage kids and his ex-wife (a basketball player;
he found her a coaching job!). He wrote for the New York Post, then decided to start his own black-car service
in DC, which he ran for a decade. He became the personal driver for a handful of politicians. 

Then, one Friday, he was getting his black car—a Mercedes—serviced at the dealership. He decided that
he’d rather sell Mercedes cars than drive people around in them, so he found the manager, told him
everything he knew about Mercedes (which turns out to be a lot; Wolf loves Mercedes), and got hired. He closed
up his business that afternoon and started his new career the following Monday.

He talked to me about socialism, communism, sex changes, smoking (he’s for it) and vegetarianism (he’s
against it). He touted his wife’s skills as a writer and editor—her journalistic resume makes me envious.
He told me that lemon cleanses the liver, and he handed me a lemon juice container that he carries with him
everywhere, and he told me to squirt some in my water bottle. I did.

An hour passed. I thanked Wolf for our conversation, but said I had to get some work done. He shook my hand,
told me my handshake was strong and I must have Slavic roots in my ancestry, then suggested I park in a hidden
lot “where finding a spot is really easy.” 

He called me Wolfette. I’m honored.
