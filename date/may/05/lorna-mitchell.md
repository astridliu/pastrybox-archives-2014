Conference season is upon us, as my TripIt account could probably tell you.  I spend a lot of time at
conferences (actually far too much, if you look at the accounts for my one-woman business!) and can often be
found evangelising the benefits of events. There is so much to learn! So many people to meet! So many hallway
discussions to have! So many new ideas to have and to share! So many projects to hack up in the bar!

But what if that doesn’t sound like you? What if you don’t want to stay up late, try to make small talk
with (potentially drunk) people you don’t know, go to a new place, or listen to topics that might not even
be useful to you in the future? I’m a server-side developer, a profession that stereotypically doesn’t
value social interaction all that much. There’s plenty you can do without leaving your chair so it’s
tempting to leave weird in-person gatherings to other people. You know, the ones with social skills.

I’m here to say: go anyway. You don’t have to enjoy it. You don’t have to talk to anyone. Try a few of
the sessions, go shopping instead if it isn’t working out for you. But however you approach conference
season, don’t write the whole events thing off as something for “other people” until you’ve tried it.
There are plenty of affordable events all over the world; I bet you can find something that’s achievable for
your budget/lifestyle/location/professional aspirations.

I’m not asking you to have fun, I’m asking you to go along and see what you can find there that works for
you.
