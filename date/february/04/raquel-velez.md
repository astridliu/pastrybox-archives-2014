When I was a beginner web developer, my first thought whenever I visited a website was to find out out who was
involved. I always asked myself, “Which one of them is the most like *me*?” I usually started with faces
— “Do any of them look like me?” And then I moved to names — “Do any of them have names like
mine?”

In the case of many websites: No, none of them were like me.

Does it matter?

Yes — it *absolutely* matters. 

Some of us spend our whole lives constantly reminded about the things over which we have no control (race,
gender, ethnicity, neighborhood in which we grew up, etc). Often these reminders are followed by (usually
inaccurate) stereotypes about our intelligence, personality, fashion sense, etc. Over time, we
(understandably) start to believe it all, and it infiltrates every aspect of our daily lives.

Role models are important. When the people we look up to look like us, act like us, and have similar
experiences as us, we start to believe that *we* can be like *them*. As students, we need to know that we can
learn the hard stuff, despite the memories of the morons in our past who tried to convince us otherwise. Role
models help us keep going. 

Unfortunately, as in the case of the aforementioned websites, not all of us have role models when we need
them. So what should we do?

We keep going anyway. 

Like it or not, our success is defined more by how we act than by how we’re born. 

Be persistent, learn constantly, and ignore the haters.

Become the role model that someone else looks up to, to know that *they* can make it, too.
