    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>My wife and I have two young boys, ages one and three, and we’re awakened anywhere between 4:30 AM and 7:30 AM, even on the weekends. It sucks. I know, we signed up for this when we decided to have kids, but that won’t dissuade me from moaning about it. When the elder boy gets into the groove and sleeps late, the little one wakes up at 5 AM with a load in his pants. Just when Sir Pants-A-Lot gets back into the groove, the older one decides to escape his room, tiptoe to our bedside and abruptly terminate what little REM sleep we’re able to savor, causing minor heart attacks in the process. I’ll hear a little voice say, “Hi, daddy” in my ear, and I’ll open my eyes to find a little face staring at me. If you’re not used to that, it is terrorizing, even if the little face is your own child. So, as you can imagine, with so little sleep, there are many mornings I’m not in a stellar mood. If you pepper in the complete lunatics I dodge on Interstate 95 during my commute to work, then you’ll understand why I’m particularly void of pleasantries in the morning hours. But my kid said “hi” to me, and I’m holding on to that.</p><p>After pulling into the parking lot near my office, I walk over to the cashier, who is perched in a metal box slightly larger than an airplane lavatory. We’re in the middle of a brutal winter in Philadelphia, so lately, he’s been huddled in there fighting for warmth as the temperature struggles to escape the single digits. When I arrive at his door, he slides it open and belts out “Good morning!” I’m a bit taken back by it every time. This guy is so cold he can barely hand me my change, but he always greets me like I’m the king of the parking lot.</p><p>I then pop into my favorite coffee joint, grab a large to go, and encounter Ron. Ron is a fixture in our office neighborhood. You can usually find him standing on the corner wearing an orange jumpsuit or a third-hand delivery service jacket. He does odd jobs for some of the businesses, but mostly he just hangs out and smokes. You can always count on Ron for a hearty “How ya doin’!” My favorite is when you respond “Fine, thanks,” to which he responds, “Aiiiiiight!” Ron doesn’t have a lot going on throughout his day, but you can’t walk by without him greeting you.</p><p>As I enter our office building, the maintenance crew is busy hauling the dumpsters from the curb through the lobby (we have an old-school building with no loading dock). The guys are filthy and tired, and it’s only 7:30 AM. But Frank, Eddie, Agustin, and the rest of the crew always stop to welcome me and give me a nice pat on the shoulder.</p><p>When I enter our office, I’m still dragging because I have yet to take a sip of my rapidly cooling coffee. And I’m still fuming about the jerk who cut me off on my drive. I’m already thinking about the zillion things I have to do, and the limited time I have to get it all done. I make a bee-line back to my office without saying a word so I can blitz through my important email before we meet for our daily status meeting. I’ll start firing off chat questions usually without even pausing to type the words “good morning” to the person I’m trying to get answers from. Then I stop and think. This is ridiculous.</p><p>We are in the business of facilitating communications. We stare at screens all day so we can make positive experiences for others who stare at their screens all day. We strive to make people feel comfortable, welcome, and wanted in an artificial reality. Yet, in real life, we dart to our computers, put on our headphones, and hide from each other. We input our conversations through keyboards, often when the person with which we are conversing is right next to us. When we get up because our legs are numb, we’ll pass by each other as if we said hello at some point, but never really did. We’re on coffee-fueled autopilot, blissfully unaware of our surroundings until we’re put into a situation where we need to be. Our perspective is skewed.</p><p>If being a toddler, working in a 5 degree box, or being one step away from homeless is what it takes to reconnect with our humanity, we should reassess. We should start by not taking our interpersonal relationships for granted. We should talk to each other. We should look each other in the eye. And at the very least, we should say “hello.” It’s free.</p>
