I find myself consciously procrastinating more than I would like. I’ll read an email, a GitHub issue or pull
request and think “I can come back to this later. I’d rather just code”. Over time the items on my
mental to-do list start to build up until I have a decreasing hope of ever getting them complete.

You see, to-do lists are like a burrito. If you fill it with too many things it falls apart and then you cry
and they kick you out of Chipotle.

This week I’ve started trying to change that. Rather than saying “later”, if I really mean to get back
to something, I’ll deal with it __right away__. Even if it means the reply or review is shorter, at least
the task gets pushed on a little and I’m not a bottleneck for progress. I want to start dealing with things
immediately.

There’s this story I recently read about Susan O’Connell — a Zen Master who’s taught the “deal with
it only once” principle. 

One of her students was meeting with her and they talked about getting tea sometime soon. Rather than dealing
with it later, she pulled out her notepad and set a date right then and there. Her idea was that you should
deal with something only once. Do it now. Once done, it’s off your mind and you can fully focus on the next
matter at hand.

There isn’t really any science behind this. A lot of us will say “I can decide on that or reply to that
later” to many of the tasks we end up each day, but we put them aside for later. __Avoid putting off those
small decisions so they don’t weigh at the back of your mind.__

If you read an email, write a quick reply to it right away. Don’t let it sit there. Add thoughts, even if
brief, to ongoing pull requests. Schedule those meetings you really want to get into your calendar. 

Related is another useful rule I’ve read about by David Allen — it’s called the two-minute rule. If a
task can be done in less than two minutes, do it right now. You could stretch that to five minutes, but it
just means one less thing to worry about.

__Take actions, move onto the next thing, rinse and repeat.__

must return to the rest of my to-do list:*

can’t download nachos?*

“you’re right” but you didn’t. So, you win.*
