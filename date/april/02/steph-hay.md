My first job out of college was at George Mason University. It’s where I cut my teeth on content strategy,
UX, and IA before they were formal things.

But more importantly, it’s where I met my dear friend
[Audrey](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/428957/aud.jpg), who became my supervisor and mentor. I was
struggling with the territorial attitudes of higher ed, but Audrey seemed to manage every working interaction
with grace and a positive attitude. 

So one day I walked into her office and asked, “Seriously, how do you build bridges with these
people?!”

She stood up, closed her office door, and said, “When I start to feel frustrated by them, I waddle like a
duck, and their negativity just rolls off my back.” She flicked her hands up in the air. “That’s
it.”

She then shook her whole body, waddling from top-to-bottom, laughed, and opened the door.

It really does work.
