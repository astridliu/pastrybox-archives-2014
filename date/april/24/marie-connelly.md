We have this tendency to think things are much simpler than they are. Brad Frost pointed this out a few months
ago with [his piece here on the Pastry Box](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-january-28)
about the word “just”.

We say it to individuals, but also to groups of people, to organizations, to entire industries.

*"Why don’t you just…"* 

Fix your websites. Improve this archaic process. Use this new technology.

We’re a community of problem solvers, and that’s a great skill to have. But we can’t solve problems we
don’t actually understand. And much as we might be loathe to admit it, problem solving isn’t simply a
matter of coming up with the right answer. Truly solving a problem requires finding a solution that can
actually be implemented with the resources at hand.

I’m as guilty of this as anyone, believe me. Somewhere along the way, my critical-thinking skills got
distilled down to looking at a situation and asking, *“Why is this __broken__?”* or  *“Where did they
make the wrong assumptions?”* 

Those questions introduce assumptions of their own though; that I know more about this problem than the people
living with it, for one. 

These days, I’m trying to take a step back and ask, *“How did this come to be?”* instead. *“What am I
not seeing here?”* is a nice follow up.

Next time you’re tempted to jump in with a *“Why don’t you just…”* I invite you to do the same.
