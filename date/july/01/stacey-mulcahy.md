The difference between me just reading something and me respecting what I read is spelling and basic grammar.


If you want your audience to take the time to truly appreciate what you have written, you need to take the
time to utilize the spell check feature. Certain mediums and contexts have made us lazy, and we often take
some forgivable liberties due to the limitations these mediums impose. This is no excuse for other contexts:
email, blog posts, reports, presentations, etc. 

When someone reads your writing, spelling and grammar are the difference between them wanting to shake your
hand versus them wanting to pat you on the head. A limp fish is still better than a hair tousling, because the
former says more about the other person than the latter.
