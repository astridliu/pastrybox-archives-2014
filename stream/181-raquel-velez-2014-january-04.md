> “Dime con quien andas y te diré quien eres”(Tell me who your friends are, and
> I’ll tell you who you are)— Spanish proverb

Your friends matter — a lot.

The good ones are like fountains: they’re active listeners, help you celebrate your wins, and give you
valuable perspective when things go south. Simply put, they energize you.

The bad ones are like sewers: they complain, spread rumors, and make you doubt yourself on the regular. In
short, they suck the life out of you.

Surround yourself with fountains and limit the interaction you have with sewers. You’ll feel better in the
long run.
