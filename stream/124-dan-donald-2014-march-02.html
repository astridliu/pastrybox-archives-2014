       <p>I’ve always been a fan of Batman. When I first got into reading comics, it was the 90’s darker, more brooding version of the character that really grabbed me. Some graphic novels, like <cite>Arkham Asylum</cite>, were beautiful artefacts regardless of their source material. At the same time, repeats of the campy 60’s <cite style="font-style: normal;">Batman</cite> TV show were shown on a Saturday morning. Even as child, I was amazed at the contrast the character and his world could encompass.</p><p>Comics as an art form always appealed to me, as much for the story and art as what happens between the panels. While occasionally appearing simplistic, juvenile or cheesy to some, they provide a mechanism where the reader does a lot of the work. Your imagination carries the material somewhere else.</p><p>Shortly after getting into regular reading of Batman, X-Men, Green Lantern and others, the Tim Burton <cite style="font-style: normal;">Batman</cite> film came out. Another different take on the character; slightly changing the origin of the Joker, the (interesting choice of) actors taking the characters to new places. The dark, gothic take on it was almost a period film but actually still quite light and fun — definitely a Burton film. What he then did with the sequel <cite>Batman Returns</cite>, it was more his film than in any way slavish to source material. While it didn’t have the same acclaim as the first, his take on Catwoman and The Penguin have stayed with us and returned something back to the cannon of what Batman is.</p><p>What I love isn’t necessarily what we read or see on screen but the fact that these titles are a creative framework. Since the late 1930’s Batman has been through so many writers’ and artists’ hands through comics, cartoons, TV shows, merchandise and films. Throughout each, they’re essentially the same characters. A few core ideas remain relatively consistent, while the interpretation is up to the current creative team. Even these core elements have been reinvented on occasion.</p><p>I count screenwriting as a hobby, though I’ve so much to learn. The process of getting from concept to screen fascinates me for its failures as much as its successes. The film made of <cite>Watchmen</cite>  interested me for that reason; here was an apparent literal translation of a book most people thought was unfilmable. Aside from whether you liked or disliked it, I think as an example of this approach to the work it was really interesting. From what I understand, they pretty much used panels from the book as the storyboard. For me it didn’t work because it really was a piece of work, made for the original medium and time it was created in, that didn’t translate so well directly.</p><p>A few years ago I went to a seminar by <a href="http://mckeestory.com">Robert McKee</a> (whose book <cite>Story</cite> is dense but very detailed about the craft of story). I’ve never seen someone talk for days on end, barely looking at his notes and be consistently engaging. Walking past him on the way out, I had to ask for his main piece of advice to a would-be screenwriter: “Write the truth” (which is essentially his catchphrase). He was totally right. What is it <em>really</em> about? Who <em>are</em> these characters?</p><p>When I watch one of these superhero films, for me it’s about what creative choices were made from the source material (which often spans decades and many interpretations), what did they see as their <em>truth</em> of the character(s)? Even if the film doesn’t turn out so well, I still find this fascinating.</p><p>With my favourite character, he’s been interpreted in so many ways from a campy TV show, cheesy films and&nbsp;<cite>Super Friends</cite> through to someone unhinged and dangerous, someone who comes up against the worst and most violent and demented characters around. Some of these are suitable for young kids while others are definitively not.</p><p>These comic book characters are capable of surviving countless reinventions and interpretations. Every creative team adds something to the mythology, however long their run. Captain America has been at times as cartoony and patriotic as his name suggests but also at times embroiled in serious times of espionage and uncertainty (within the context of someone who is a super soldier).</p><p>To my mind, Superman is about the toughest character to work with. Consider the basics: he’s an alien baby sent to Earth who has incredible powers and a fighter for truth, justice…and all that. As time’s moved on, he’s become too powerful, too strong. There’s no real sense of jeopardy. We know he’ll win in the end — he’s the good guy. Being too powerful almost negates any real sense of dilemma or chance he’ll not survive. As a framework, he’s the archetype of a superhero but not necessarily the easiest to transfer beyond comics in a relatable way. DC killed him off for a period with a view to showing him as being fallible, that he wasn’t all powerful (and I’m sure in reality to drive more comic sales). If you’ve not seen it, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PlwDbSYicM">Max Landis’ rant about The Death &amp; Return of Superman</a>.</p><p>So when superhero films like these come out, it’s not just my inner 10 year old that gets excited to see them, it’s trying to understand the creative journey that might’ve happened behind the scenes; to see what ‘truth’ the writers and director saw in the source material, which itself often has many versions. There have been some really poor films made…from Roger Corman’s <cite>Fantastic 4</cite> to the 1990 version of Captain America and depending on your point of view, many others too. Search the web for Tim Burton’s aborted attempt at&nbsp;<cite>Superman Lives</cite>, which would’ve starred Nicholas Cage, and check out what his take would’ve been and early costume fittings. Reading stories of ‘development hell’ for Superman (and other superheroes) over the years has give me an indication of how difficult it has been for so many reasons.</p><p>The treatment of characters and story is interesting because they can be almost anything (though ultimately still considered fantasy) and can have a very different tone or perspective — each creative hand can find something different in them. It serves to remind me how much capacity we have with creative works like brands and websites. What’s the truth in your project? What is the core of the brand you’re working with? What does this website really need to communicate?</p>
