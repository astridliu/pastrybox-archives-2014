    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>Recently, I attended a local event here in New York City. It was a rather typical affair: colleagues and peers all rubbing elbows in the repetitive humdrum affair of networking. There was one conversation I had, however, that dare I say will sit with me for the rest of my life. I heard a phrase that I had never heard before, but one that I have tried to practice my entire career: <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_honesty">intellectual honesty</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>Harvard ethicist Louis M. Guenin describes the “kernel” of intellectual honesty to be “a virtuous disposition to eschew deception when given an incentive for deception.”<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short">(1)</a></p></blockquote><p>This method of problem solving is characterized by “an unbiased, honest attitude” in the face of overwhelming incentives to skew the world in our favor. This disposition was discussed in Wiener’s 1964 paper entitled <em>“Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary Scientist”.</em> Going forward he perceived science to be less an individual act and more of a group one. This “intellectual corporation”, as Wiener put it, was not always guaranteed “to do great work”:</p><blockquote><p>There’s another illusion that the more papers are being published, the more science is being done. However, a large number of <em>bad</em> papers means less science is being done.</p><p>—<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short">Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary Scientist</a></p></blockquote><p>If this army of scientists producing potentially bad science wasn’t enough there was a further risk that the correct scientific truths would be purposefully ignored because they were unpopular, misunderstood or worst of all: pushed forward by unpopular people. </p><p>This has been the case for many giants whose shoulders we stand on today: scientists who persisted even though their ideas were considered laughable or if they themselves were prejudiced against. All of their contributions are now considered truths, facts, and laws. </p><p>Looking for some examples? Let’s consider two. First, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin#Doctorate">Cecilia Payne</a> (the first woman to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard) spent four years from 1925 to 1929 doubting her thesis <em>“Stellar Atmospheres, A Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars”</em> because she was dissuaded by her dissertation reviewer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell">Henry Norris Russell</a>. <strong>Today it is considered to be one of the most brilliant Ph.D. theses ever written in astronomy.</strong></p><p>Second, in 1838 Michael Faraday first suggested that electromagnetic forces as fields that surround objects with such properties. This foundational scientific truth was largely ignored by the scientific community. <em>But Faraday persisted,</em> and almost <strong>20 years later he was vindicated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Maxwell">Maxwell’s equations</a></strong> which we still use today.</p><p>At this point you might be thinking: “we are not scientists and software does not require the same level of scientific rigor, as well, science.” Yet, the idea persists. Just because it originates within the hallowed chambers of scientific achievement, it is not limited to them. Much of what we do today is owed to the same principles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del">Gödel’s incompleteness theorems</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing thesis</a>; the list goes on. </p><p>So this is now more important than ever when considered in the context of day-to-day perception and decision making in our “distributed by default” style of communication on the Internet. If we accept that the <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/charlie-robbins/2014-april-3">medium is the vessel</a>, then by definition one is constantly forming opinions based on the emotionally skewed communication of opinions from those we choose to follow. </p><p>The very idea of “following” as it is used today indeed itself suggests this bias that is taken for granted and accepted as fact. Then shouldn’t this acceptance of bias as fact, or put more bluntly, this <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2014/01/17/the-death-of-expertise/">“Death of Expertise”</a> leave us all in our own version of the dark ages? <em>It very well could,</em> but to embrace intellectual honesty is to do one’s part to prevent these disastrous scenarios:</p><blockquote><p>Integrity demands that when a thing is proved wrong, you admit it is proved wrong. But that is not all. “Proved wrong” is very different from “looking peculiar.” Quantum theory looked extremely peculiar when it was started. It didn’t fit any of the preconceived ideas. </p><p>—<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short">Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary Scientist</a></p></blockquote><p>Yet embracing intellectual honesty is more than integrity because if one constant holds true across any community it is that there is no constant among the minds of its members. This means that you will have to deal with those who will doubt you. Who will disagree with you. Who will <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/b2x0j8q1megb">call your ideas cancer.</a> </p><blockquote><p>A person who is to live up to the highest ideas of scientific integrity cannot be led aside by the fact that a piece of work fits the latest style, that everybody’s doing it. They’ve got to be willing to follow it out, even if it doesn’t fit the latest style, if it fits their idea of how the field ought to develop.</p><p>—<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short">Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary Scientist</a></p></blockquote><p>This is what is meant by <em>“Intellectual honesty and the dissenting idea”.</em> Dissent is good. Dissent is necessary. Dissent is what moves the needle of humanity. Dissent tempered with honesty and experience mind you, mindless zealots need not apply. And don’t forget to leave your personal attacks at home with the rest of your emotional baggage.</p><p>And how does one acquire the experience to know the difference? To navigate between what is impartial and what is personal? That’s the best part of intellectual honesty: if you are unsure of something you can go have a rational, civil, and unbiased conversation with anyone and everyone in your peer group. And you know that your peer group is not lying to you or to the public. </p><p>So today try it out: accept intellectual honesty into your heart for just a little while. We all have biases; so view what is obviously and inherently biased as biased. Not as intellectual fact. </p><p>In other words:</p><figure><img src="https://i.cloudup.com/6KT4NLhJkc.gif" alt="What you believe?" title="What you believe?"><p></p><p>Because, in closing:</p><blockquote><p>Anybody who believes that they can get away with something that they know isn’t good enough, but will fool everybody else, is a fool.</p><p>—<a href="http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short">Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary Scientist</a></p></blockquote></figure>
