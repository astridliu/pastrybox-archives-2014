    <div class="thought-content">
       <p><span class="s1">It was just past 6 a.m., much too early in the morning, but the airport was already bustling. Was it normally this busy? I wondered, as I found the right bag-drop counter, and congratulated myself for having made it before the queue got too long. This should be quick, and I should get home in time for lunch. But the moment I dropped my backpack between my feet, a woman in airline uniform with a furrowed face came up to me and said, “There’s been a three-hour delay.”<i> Ah.</i> Well then, in the lottery of things that could go wrong, I suppose this wasn’t the end of the world, I told myself.</span></p><p><span class="s1">As she was moving away, I hastily asked, “Am I in the right queue?” and that was my first mistake of the day. She shuffled me towards the left, behind a slightly longer queue. I swallowed my consternation. One day, I really ought to stop trying to do the right thing all the time. I glanced ahead: there were only two sets of passengers in front of me. Not the end of the world, I told myself again, and settled down to wait.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Twenty minutes later, we hadn’t budged. This was odd, even for a three-hour delay. I turned my head and noticed that the queue had now snaked around the pillar at the corner. In front of me was a small family, a couple with two young children. They were in good spirits—the boy, no more than three, sat patiently on a large, soft bag. The girl, who was about five years old, held onto her mother’s hand. After an eternity, the passengers at the counter moved on, and the next set of travellers shuffled forward.</span></p><p><span class="s1">I looked at my watch: it had been a whole hour since I stood here. There had been time to do a quick online search, so at least I had an explanation. The delay was due to the aftermath of a computer system problem yesterday which caused havoc, separating travellers from their bags all over Europe. It had since been fixed, but the complexity of modern travel meant that one thing going wrong had after-effects that rippled across borders, countries, time and space. Oddly enough, I felt grateful. Yesterday must have been hell. Even with this wait, at least I would still make it home today—with my luggage. I wouldn’t make it home in time for lunch, but certainly for dinner.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Last night, I’d gotten back to my rented apartment much later than I meant to, but still managed to make a simple, lovely vegetable soup of onion, carrot, potato and watercress. I had the leftovers early this morning, despite it being an unusual breakfast fare by most counts. Though stuck in the queue, it meant I wasn't hungry. Because it was good soup—I wasn’t thirsty either. So I stood for a while, silently counting my blessings and thinking about things that went right.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">I was woken from my reverie by a happy squeal from the mother who jumped and gave the embarrassed floor manager a big bear-hug. It seemed as if they’d worked a miracle. When the mother took a couple of steps away from the counter to check on her children, I asked, “Have you got far to go?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="s1">“Canada,” she said, with a resigned shrug, but still, she smiled. “They are re-booking us through Germany, we should make it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="s1">All good news. Then, it occurred to me that perhaps I’d been waiting in line for so long because they had not separated passengers who required re-bookings and those who didn’t. And if they did— would that have been fair? Would that have been more efficient? Would that have meant a small number of people were happier at the expense of the majority who would have had to wait longer? Would it have mattered?</span></p><p><span class="s1">The little girl was getting restless. On her back she wore a small backpack, the front of which was a large mesh pocket. Stuffed deep into the mesh pocket was a plush bunny, obviously well loved. There was also a smaller toy that I couldn’t quite see, tucked to one side. The bunny was well settled, the elastic of the pocket coming just under his arms, so that his head and ears flopped freely every time she moved.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class="s1">How strange that as adults we no longer have these symbolic personifications that we are allowed to keep with us: a companion, something that comforts, a sign of familiarity. Being “adult” means we have to stifle these things, our grown-up vices less immediately obvious, deeply entwined with other social notions or afflictions of the self. For some, it might have been the cigarette. But the adult equivalent of a plush bunny today must be the smartphone. We might be less grown-up than we like to think we are. Having&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">created such complex protocols of what it means to be&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">“</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">adult</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">”</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">, we have only confused what it means&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">“</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">childish</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">”</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">“</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">child-like</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">”</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">. To what end?</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">Wasn't</span><span style="line-height: 1.4;">&nbsp;it 1st Corinthians 13? “When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child and reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up my childish ways.” But then, wasn’t it C.S. Lewis who said, “When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up”?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">Having stood in this queue for an hour and a half, I suddenly wished I had <em>my</em> own plush bunny in a mesh pocket on <em>my</em> backpack so I could somehow know that all was well in the world. But then, at home, I have a real, living cat (no doubt peering out the window at birds at this hour) and a loving husband (most likely still asleep)—the latter I am pretty sure I can convince to plot a good dinner for when I eventually make it through the front door.</span></p><p>“Next passenger please!” The airline staff at the counter flashed me a big smile.</p><p><span class="s1">I looked back at the ever-growing queue, and counted my blessings.&nbsp;</span></p>
