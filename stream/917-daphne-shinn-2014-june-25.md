Tweets in the spur of the moment. A blog with a nasty tone. ‘Digital judgement’ seems easier than saying
the same thing to someone’s face. Some of the comments my fellow content and website specialists publish
about other organisations’ websites make me feel uneasy. Often they are right in their criticism. But are
they right in judging? I’d like to join the conversation, but when it seems to start as an attack, I keep
out of it.

[At Dare Conference 2013 Phil Powell closed his talk with the meme “Everybody you meet is fighting a battle
you know nothing about.”](http://2013.dareconf.com/speakers/powell) He was referring to ‘personal’
battles people cope with, but I think it can also apply to the work itself. Having done a couple digital
projects for complex organisations, I know the battles of deadlines, politics, budget, priorities, people and
the inevitable compromises. I think most of you do.

So someone’s solution doesn’t seem right to you. You know what? It might have been a hundred times worse
in the first draft, after someone in the board laid down personal demands. Technical reasons at the back-end
could prevent a better solution just now. They might have made a choice to put most of the budget into a
functionality that was more important to their clients. Maybe a plan to improve on it is ready to be
implemented. Or they might not know what they don’t know. I don’t think there are a lot of people who make
‘bad’ choices on purpose.

If you feel like attacking or severely criticizing someone else’s work, it would be nice if you ask them for
a reaction first. (No, that’s not the same as giving them the option to reply in the comments.) Or at least
phrase your judgement as a question or a personal opinion. Like: I don’t understand your choice to […],
can you explain? Then keep in mind they can’t always tell you the entire story. Not all organisations
appreciate their internal struggles being broadcasted in public. But it might eventuate in an offline
conversation you both learn from.

Even better: Judge your own work, the work you DO know everything about, and write about THAT. It should be
easy to be critical of your own work. Lots of us are, right? And you should be able to explain your choices,
or come to the conclusion that — in hindsight — they were not the right ones. If you can’t do that ‘in
public’ — because your client doesn’t want you to — think about how you would feel if someone calls
you on it without you being able to explain?

Try not to attack. Start a conversation instead.
