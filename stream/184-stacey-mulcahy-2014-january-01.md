# A New Year

It’s a new year. This year, let’s make our resolutions ones that will benefit all of us. Let this year
find us: 

 *   

## Creating less crap

 Karma is a boomerang and if we keep creating shit, we can only expect to be stuck polishing it one day
too.

 *  

## Simplifying

 Seek clarity in communication. When it comes to words, if the small ones will suffice, don’t unnecessarily
opt for the big ones.  Let bespoke return to the world of tailoring. Stop talking about responsive design like
it’s only about layout.

 *  

## Being Empathetic

Give weight to numbers, but listen to users. Analytics might tell us that the beloved full screen modal pop-up
works, but human beings tell us otherwise. Numbers can weave one hell of a one-sided tale, if you let them.


 *  

## Being Supportive

Celebrate other people’s successes as you would your own. Click on every ad in a free app, buy every
t-shirt, print or book created by your colleagues. Reward these labors of love. Start your own. 

Execution  ideas. 

Do not let your own fear throw down before you do.

 *  

## Complaining Less, Acting More

Dial down the negativity. Let us start to weed the phrases “fail” and “you’re doing it wrong” from
our vocabulary. Hit unsubscribe to the social shaming and leave it in the schoolyard.

 *  

## Doing more of what we don’t know, and less of what we do 

Aim for expertise, not expert. The moment you have mastered something and are comfortable, you have invited
boredom in for a nice cup of tea. The next thing you know, you’re married, dressing alike and complaining
about the lack of obligatory sex.

Do not get into bed with boredom.

 *  

## Challenging the Status Quo

Just because it’s a best practice, doesn’t mean it is the one that works for you. Don’t blindly accept
what is considered best or right. We can’t grow and evolve ideas if everyone accepts them as they
are.

 *  

## More Creating, Less Creatives

Put more weight on doing and less on being. 

This year, let us be more by doing just a little bit less.
