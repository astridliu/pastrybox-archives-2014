“Sometimes knowing gets in the way.”

That’s what [one of my deskmates](http://adrianavarro.net) said aloud while out to lunch a few weeks ago
trying to brainstorm new project ideas. He’s a former student at [NYU’s Interactive Telecommunications
Program](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/); I moonlight teaching at [Parsons’ Design + Technology
program](http://mfadt.parsons.edu/). Both programs are difficult for me to describe in spite of how amazing
they are. Graduates have gone on to [found interactive installation agencies](http://incrediblemachines.net/)
or [created celebrated indy games](http://www.ridiculousfishing.com/). They’ve designed [beautiful digital
products](http://verygreyc.com/) for large agencies and [told wonderful stories through
interactivity](https://designenvy.aiga.org/john-lennon%E2%80%94the-bermuda-tapes-design-io/). They are
[experimenters](http://www.bruzed.com/), [artists](http://maniartstudio.com/),
[tinkerers](http://larawarman.com/), [designers](http://jencotton.com/),
[curiosities](http://www.bonappetit.com/trends/article/make-your-own-high-fructose-corn-syrup-with-artist-maya-weinstein).

Some students come in with existing experience in design, code, or electronics when they first enter their
programs. Many do not. While both schools have [esteemed](http://shiffman.net/)
[faculty](http://cargocollective.com/charliewhitney), the students’ interests are so wide and varied that
the onus is on the individual to teach themselves whatever it is they need to learn to realize their ideas.
These students haven’t put in enough raw hours to assess the difficulty of a challenge. Their vision isn’t
clouded by expertise. They charge in headstrong, and the resulting output is often incredible and
wonderful.

It’s rare when someone comes out of these programs magically incredible at anything specific. Two years of
scrambling madly to learn how to build something from nothing is hardly going to generate rock-star designers
or coders. Perhaps that’s not the point. Maybe knowing how to make everything makes it that much harder to
make anything great.
