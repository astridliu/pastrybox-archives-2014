I like beer. I used to drink bad beer in volume when I was a college jerk, but I prefer to drink really good
beer in smaller quantities now that I’m a refined gentleman.

If you asked me what my favorite brewery is, that’s easy. It’s Delaware’s Dogfish Head. Founded in 1995,
Dogfish Head is inventive — they age dark brown ales in [giant Paraguayan wood
tanks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEciC3Q5k14), they created a [homegrown device called
Randall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmPrg1pq1x8) to infuse their beers with other ingredients on the fly,
and they have a giant [steampunk tree house](http://www.dogfish.com/company/tangents/steampunk-treehouse.htm)
on the grounds of their brewery.

While all of that stuff is super cool, I appreciate something else about them even more — the spirit of
collaboration they foster for their industry. A good old you-show-me-yours and I’ll-show-you-mine way of
doing business.

## Collaborating to Compete

Dogfish Head’s Founder and President Sam Calagione knows what his industry is up against. Despite the fact
that there were over 2,500 craft breweries in the United States in 2013 (compared to only 78 back in 1976,
according to the [Brewer’s
Association](http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/business-tools/craft-brewing-statistics/number-of-breweries)),
and [craft beer production has grown 71% in just six
years](http://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhuyghe/2014/01/14/what-suntory-beam-can-learn-from-craft-beer-entrepreneurs/),
the mountain craft brewers must climb is significant. Just two mass brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) and
SABMiller, control 75% of the worldwide market, and ABI and SABMiller control 39% and 29% of the United States
beer market, respectively. That means that U.S. craft brewers have to scratch and claw to maintain and grow
their 32% slice of the pie.

Perhaps because of this, Dogfish Head and other brewing companies like Sierra Nevada, Allagash, Stone, New
Belgium, Avery, and Brooklyn (to name a few) have openly, willingly, and enthusiastically collaborated with
their competitors. The Street’s Jason Notte [surfaces the likely genesis of this sharing
attitude:](http://www.thestreet.com/story/11997284/1/9-great-collaborative-beers.html)

In other words, they aren’t precious about all of their secrets, because it makes no sense to be. They
purposefully work together, because they realize the collective brainpower they harness and put into action
will serve to increase their market share and tip the scales more quickly than going it alone.

Smart.

At the end of the day, beer is comprised of four main ingredients: water, yeast, malt, and hops. Beer is beer.
A brewery differentiates itself by creating unique twists on beer styles, changing their business strategies,
and creating lasting relationships. Dogfish Head has experienced fifteen years of double-digit growth. They
are expanding their capacity and distribution, and they are further diversifying their business into
[large-scale partnerships](http://www.eataly.com/birreria/),
[hospitality](http://www.dogfish.com/community/blogfish/members/justin-williams/the-dogfish-inn-lets-spend-the-night-together.htm)
and [food products](http://vimeo.com/69022105). I’m confident Sam Calagione’s collaborative spirit had
more than just a little to do with this success.

## Hey, It Worked for Them

I am the CEO of a 34-person digital design firm called [Happy Cog](http://happycog.com). I find plenty of
inspiration in our industry, but if I had to identify an area in which it sorta smells like bad fish, it’s
how we work together to 1) define our collective agenda, and 2) further it. This is where the craft beer
industry can teach us all a thing or two. Calagione [articulates Dogfish and the craft beer industry’s
collaborative philosophy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bws2R7Jq7Uo) and suggests the tech industry can
certainly follow suit.

Web design is a $20 billion industry in the United States. It grew 4.5% in 2013. While more than 70% of the
websites built in the U.S. are built by professionals in client services, [do-it-yourself website creation
companies](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-analysis-design-industry-180000355.html) like Wix (valued at
$700 million) and Squarespace are changing the conversation. And while no single web design firm accounts for
more than 5.0% of total industry revenue [according to
IBISWorld](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb10993697.htm), the full-service heavy hitters like R/GA,
Razorfish, Designory, DigitasLBi, and BBDO make it tough for 25-100 person boutique design firms to compete to
scale.

## The Little Agencies That Could

I challenge my industry colleagues to pause from viewing your peers as “the competition.” Take a step back
and ask yourself, “Is there something I can offer them? Is there something I can learn from them?” Yes
there is, on both counts — even if your philosophies differ or your industry niches don’t completely
align.

Let’s adjust our thinking from unnecessarily withholding our experiences, processes, and knowledge, to
openly sharing ideas that make us all better off. Don’t like RFPs? Let’s collaborate to construct a
coordinated, uncompromising stance. Hate it when clients ask for spec work? Let’s adamantly refuse the idea
of it together, while educating those who request it in the process. If we work together, we can positively
impact our bottom lines and command a stronger voice in our industry.

Back in July of 2012, while sitting on a bar stool at Philadelphia’s Yards Brewery (I told you I liked
beer), I [tweeted this:](https://twitter.com/hoyboy/status/228995498302918656)

Since then, my business partner Greg Storey and I launched [Owner Camp](http://ownercamp.com), a retreat for
small to mid-size digital studio owners and professionals who can help them. We share experiences, trade war
stories, and forge lasting friendships. It’s the most therapeutic, engaging, and genuinely feel-good
experience I’ve ever had working in this industry. This year, we are expanding the idea beyond a bi-annual
retreat, in a concerted effort to affect meaningful change for our piece of the industry.

As I type these last few words, I shall crack open a Dogfish Head Punkin Ale, stashed away to protect it from
holiday consumption, dreaming about the industry that could be.
