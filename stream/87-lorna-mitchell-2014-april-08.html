       <p>Email is such an everyday thing, and often we see it as a bad thing. We attempt to eliminate it in our quest for Inbox Zero. Certainly I get a rush when waking on a Sunday morning to see only one or two new mails arrived while I slept. Much of my email comes from machines rather than people; both seem to think themselves important.</p><p>Consider the protocol though, not the content. Email is, in and of itself, a pretty excellent invention. It seems to get copied (badly! Looking at you, Facebook) by other major applications, but its persistence speaks for how useful it really is. I use emails a lot for business communication, as I’m sure most of us do, but I also use it for writing letters. As a way of sending unlimited content, optionally with attachments, asynchronously, I’m at a loss to beat it. I send emails to my husband when I’m away and in the wrong timezone to phone him, I got the news of my sister’s pregnancy by email (while I was in the wrong timezone to phone, there’s a theme here), and I now regularly email long letters to my best friend who very inconsiderately moved to the wrong side of the planet. Sometimes I email people who are in the right timezone for a phone call, but whose thoughts I would like in a non-urgent manner, or who will need time for research or reflection before replying.</p><p>All too often, email represents the place where GitHub notifications arrive, or where we ensure a paper trail between client and supplier. Instead, I challenge you to embrace it as a letter-writing* medium, surprise someone with a note in their inbox and make them smile!</p><p>* <em>Letters themselves are delightful, but how many of your friends do you have a postal address for?</em></p>
