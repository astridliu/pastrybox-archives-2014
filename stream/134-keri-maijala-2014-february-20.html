    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>I was an independent consultant for a little over three years. I loved it. I loved the variety, the freedom, and the daily outfits of hoodies and yoga pants. Even so, I decided to jump back into the world of full-time employment.</p><p>It wasn’t about the money. I have the good fortune of being in a discipline full of lovely, kind people who often sent referrals, so I was getting plenty of work.</p><p>But I missed the daily collaboration with other content strategists and user experience professionals. And after three years of working (and living) solo, I sometimes found myself looking up at 2 PM on a Thursday and realizing I hadn't left the house all week. </p><p>“This,” I thought, “is not healthy.”</p><p>But returning to full-time work seemed like I was broadcasting failure. Being my own boss was appealing to everyone else. So <em>sexy</em>. Why in the world would I give it up?</p><p>Around this time I was asked to interview with two big-name companies. Joining one of these companies would make sense. It would certainly create the sexy narrative I longed for.</p><p>So I labored on the assignments they gave me, confidently presented my work, and had one-on-one discussions with lots of people. And though my experience varied from person to person, the overall feeling I got was, “Impress us.”</p><p>And sure, that’s part of any interview process, especially at a big name. But shouldn’t any successful relationship be mutually beneficial? Shouldn’t there be a conversation about what I wanted as well? At one point I asked an interviewer, “How will you interact with this position?” and was told, “I’m not going to talk about that right now.” I was floored.</p><p>During all of this, I was consulting for a little-known company in Sunnyvale. The woman who hired me was an adored former boss, and her team was made up of smart, talented women. They were tackling interesting problems and I had fun working with them.</p><p>Sunnyvale wanted me full time. </p><p>&nbsp;“<em>Unsexxxxxxxxxy</em>,” my brain hissed. After years of trying to build my career with big names and the “glamour” of working for myself, would it look like I was settling? “But this is a great team,” I thought. “The work is super interesting. I’ll get to build a brand from the ground up. When does anyone get to do that in an established company?”</p><p><em>“Unnnnnnsexxxxxxxxxxy</em>,” my brain insisted. Taking this job meant I would need to repeat my company name and explain what we do. There would be no envious looks. No one clambering to talk to me at meetups or conferences. A steeper hill to climb to get a speaking engagement. </p><p>But in contrast to the big names, Sunnyvale was working really hard to make sure this was a good fit all around. They rewrote the job description to better match my interests and skills. They took my salary requirements to heart. They were cool with me starting <em>five months later</em> to accommodate my living arrangements and travel plans. </p><p>Meanwhile, from the big names, I got a turn-down and a never-heard-from-again. The rejection from the first left me heartbroken and confused, but I was relieved about number two. I knew it wasn’t a good fit, but I might have accepted because of the sheer sexiness.</p><p>Sunnyvale was still batting their not-bedroom eyes at me.</p><p>With no-gos from the sexy twins, I worried even more that taking the Sunnyvale job would look like I had no other options. </p><p>But I <em>did</em> have other options. Lots of them. I could keep consulting. I could talk to other companies. I could maybe try again with the big-name heartbreaker. </p><p>Sunnyvale continued to serenade me in sandals and black socks.</p><p>And you know, it felt good. No, it felt <i>fantastic</i>. And I realized that making a decision based on “sexy” or how it would appear to other people is a spectacularly bad idea. This was a great company with a great team making me a great offer. And honestly, who did I think I was that I assumed anyone would give a shit about my career?</p><p>Sexy is wonderful. Nothing wrong with it. But it alone can’t sustain a relationship. </p><p>I accepted the offer. It was, without a doubt, the right decision. Because sexy is as sexy does.</p><p>And damn, I’m feeling <em>sexxxxxxxxxxxy</em>.</p>
