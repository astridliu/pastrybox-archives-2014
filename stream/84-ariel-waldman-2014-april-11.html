       <p>My <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ariel-waldman/2014-february-13" class="mappr">last post</a> on the Pastry Box touched on how I never felt much of a strong&nbsp;affinity for space exploration prior to landing a job at NASA. There is one exception that I can point to, though. While living in Kansas City, I’d often spend my evenings and weekends watching documentaries. There really only seemed to be two types that I would become glued to — deep space exploration and deep sea exploration. My favorite area of space exploration has always been the very far away things that are at the edge of our understanding — black holes, dark matter, multiverses, cosmic microwave background, etc. With sea exploration, I have been endlessly fascinated with the multitude of seemingly weird-yet-amazing creatures exposed in the dark depths of the ocean. While most of my work is space-based, I’ve been sure to create side projects like&nbsp;<a href="http://seahack.org">Seahack.org</a> and a <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/arielwaldman/creepy-awesome-sea-slime/">creepy awesome sea slime</a> board for fun to satiate the deep sea creature nerd in me.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, over the years, I’ve found myself geeking out more about extraterrestrials, extremophiles and astrobiology. To me, it’s a romantic mashup of sea and space that allows my imagination run wild. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) via radio waves (and hopefully someday soon via optical pulses) is a depressingly small <a href="https://www.teamseti.org/donate">effort</a>&nbsp;relative&nbsp;to other scientific endeavors. To me, it’s one of the most significant. It’s a depressing thought to me, the idea of many civilizations even within just our own galaxy being sprinkled throughout, unable to contact one another due to the expanses of spacetime and the minuscule distance covered by our own radio waves (a pathetic 100-200 light years in a galaxy that is a hundred thousand light years in diameter). Each curious about, but without direct evidence of, each other. I was pondering the other day about what scientific discovery would I be sad about not having been made yet before I die. It’s a good question to meditate on. The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence is hands down number one for me.</p><figure><img id="bc502c297d3bc7f5760a1480e31bf4ea" alt="radio_broadcasts-636.jpg" src="https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/e0d881d4a15e0d5846d102e32603fc81/data/img/thoughts/insert/817/-bc502c297d3bc7f5760a1480e31bf4ea-d2dc34ed2c9d1e37e711105f70b75f40.full.jpg"></figure><p><small>The blue dot shows the extent to which our radio broadcasts have reached, though it’d be difficult to detect them even at that distance. Graphic by Adam Grossman and Nick Risinger.</small><br></p><p>But there are other forms of extraterrestrials that are equally fascinating to think about. The kinds that may not fit within our current viewpoint on intelligence, but are no less inspiring in their accomplishments. The tiny, perhaps microbial, extraterrestrials that may not have access to a radio tower or a spaceship, but for all we know could be relatively abundant within galaxies, and maybe even exist within our own solar system. This is what astrobiology is — the mashup of biology and space — imagining what forms of life could exist throughout the universe through the lens of how various creatures have survived on Earth. Extremophiles are a particular scientific delicacy for many astrobiologists. Extremophiles are creatures on Earth that can survive in conditions that would kill off most others. Acid, salt, cold, hot, dry, dark — it sounds like a tasting menu, but these are many of the conditions in which researchers will search for forms of life on Earth and study how they might be able to survive on other planets and moons with equally inhospitable environments. For me, this research has two interesting applications: (1) the development of space probes that will know how to search for life in our solar system and (2) the potential seeding of life in our solar system (e.g. terraforming Mars). I’ve often talked about my fascination with seeding life in the universe — the failed Russian attempts to <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/2012/01/15/could-tardigrades-survive-re-entry/">send tardigrades to Mars’ moon Phobos</a> and how certain types of <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/20120515-earth-life-survive-mars.html">lichen could survive on Mars</a>, giving other forms of life a necessary foothold to grow from. In the search for life realm, the debate is heating up over whether to look for life in the oceans of Europa (Jupiter’s moon) or Enceladus (Saturn’s moon). In an ideal world, we’d send probes to both, but the reality of funding for space exploration means we’ll be lucky if we get even one. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn25355/dn25355-3_1200.jpg">This infographic</a> touches on some of the high level considerations for debating probing one versus another. Europa currently has a lot of weight behind it partially because it was the first to receive publicity for having an ocean that could potentially support life, and thus has had a very long head-start over Enceladus, despite us having more information about the makeup of Enceladus’ ocean.</p><figure><img id="e204ec284f4e7ce367a80f9fca968c42" alt="dn25355-636.jpg" src="https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/e0d881d4a15e0d5846d102e32603fc81/data/img/thoughts/insert/817/-e204ec284f4e7ce367a80f9fca968c42-e8ae38bd9148c49e9964749901a6cd31.full.jpg"></figure><p><small>Infographic of Europa versus Enceladus produced by New Scientist.</small></p><p>These fascinations of mine are likely also a result of being friends with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Shostak">Seth Shostak</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McKay">Chris McKay</a>. Both are very notable in their field and often appear on many of the documentaries that I have watched over the years. Seth Shostak is an astronomer at the <a href="http://seti.org">SETI Institute</a> who has worked alongside other equally great people such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake">Frank Drake</a> (of the famous Drake equation), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Tarter">Jill Tarter</a> (the inspiration for Contact), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> (of original Cosmos fame). Seth is likely also one of the most hilarious astronomers you’ll meet. I recommend watching his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkxEbIxoNQI">presentation about finding ET</a> from an event I put on with Boing Boing. Chris McKay is an astrobiologist at NASA who has produced countless papers and conducted tons of field work in Earth’s extreme environments to better understand how we might find life on Mars. I remember asking Chris how many times he had been to Antarctica and he said that he had lost count after something like 20! I always love to soak up Chris’s take on space exploration. Just recently, he shared with me <a href="http://arielwaldman.com/wp-content/2014/03/McKay-2007-AdAstraBioRev.pdf">a great article he wrote</a> on how we’ve already technically contaminated Mars and how we should rethink planetary protection policy for the future of exploration.</p><figure><img id="42427dcaa1c39f84b186724747b4f285" alt="jodi_ariel-636.jpg" src="https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/e0d881d4a15e0d5846d102e32603fc81/data/img/thoughts/insert/817/-42427dcaa1c39f84b186724747b4f285-11ec10957b20786a08a282bd91f187b3.full.jpg"></figure><p><small>Me visiting the Goldstone Deep Space Network facility a few days ago.</small></p><p>I am so grateful each and every day for having discovered my own excitement for science, which has led me to meet amazing people like Seth and Chris who I can geek out with about the multitude of questions I have. Not all types of science are interesting to everyone — in my experience, people typically have one or a small handful of things that make them turn into a puddle of awe. But once you realize what your one science thing that turns you on is, your mind instantly expands as large as the universe (or multiverse), as if you’ve injected it with some type of neurological <a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/august-2007/explain-it-in-60-seconds-dark-energy">dark energy</a>.</p>
