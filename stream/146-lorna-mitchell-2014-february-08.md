When running workshops for conference speakers, my favourite thing to ask them is: What are you most afraid
of? Answers will vary, and while some worries may seem silly they are for the most part well-founded. Worries
about getting bad feedback, forgetting what to say, struggling with a second language, even worries about
falling over (actually I worry about this one a lot myself!). I focus on preparing well enough to be able to
handle the problems, spending lots of time working with speakers on connecting to projectors, testing slides,
how to use a microphone, and so on. 

As an experienced conference speaker myself, I have probably spent weeks or months of my life trying to be
prepared enough to avoid the things I’m worried about. I worry about wearing the wrong thing, having the
talk start late or end early, getting a question that I can’t handle, pitching the session incorrectly,
getting negative feedback ... on and on. I buy new outfits, practice talks almost until I can give them in my
sleep, show up hours early on the day, ask friends to ask questions on the topic for me to practice answering.
I’m not even sure I could answer my own question about what I am really afraid of.

Last year, two of those fears came true in spectacular fashion at different events. Everything I had worked so
hard for, failed. And do you know what happened next? Nothing at all. The sky did not fall in, the universe
did not implode. I won’t give those talks again, or probably be invited back to those conferences, but life
did actually go on. I’ll still prepare thoroughly because that’s the kind of person I am, but I’m trying
to let go of being afraid.
