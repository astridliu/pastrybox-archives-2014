       <p>One day last fall I thought to myself, “Man, it’d be great to generate some recurring monthly income, so what can I build to make money?”</p><p>(Oh, you’ve had that thought, too?)</p><p>So I did a workshop with the smart folks at <a href="http://agilityfeat.com/forstartups">AgilityFeat</a>, and we talked through nine different ideas I thought (a) could make money and (b) I wanted to put my energy into.</p><p>We talked about what minimum viable products might look like and early experiments to test markets or demand. We honed in on one idea, <a href="http://tougher.me/">tougher.me</a>, which CrossFitters like me would someday use to post their personal records.&nbsp;</p><p>In January, I set out to find/cultivate an audience by creating a playlist a day using Spotify, posting it to&nbsp;<a href="http://musicforwods.com/">musicforwods.com</a> (WOD stands for “workout of the day” in CrossFit lingo), then cross-posting that to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/musicforwods">a Facebook group</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourteen weeks in, Music for WODs is about to pass 24K likes on Facebook, while <a href="http://tougher.me/">tougher.me</a> is still in a very small beta working toward “viable.”</p><p>So here I am with two hobbies, by startup terms (i.e., “Pre-revenue” HA!) — one that’s fun to make, growing quickly, people are using on a daily basis, and is generating some grocery money through t-shirt sales. Another is fun to make, and I hope will grow, perhaps with help from the MusicForWODs Facebook audience.</p><p>In the meantime, I field questions from well-meaning folks who want to know if/how I’m making money. “How are you going to make money?” assumes I have a master plan. I don’t; I have experiments, sure, but the greatest thing I’ve learned so far is that “follow the fun” — as <a href="https://twitter.com/ptrcksmth">Patrick Smith</a> once told me — is a pretty rewarding strategy to start with.</p><p>Beyond that, what’s so bad about having a hobby?</p>
