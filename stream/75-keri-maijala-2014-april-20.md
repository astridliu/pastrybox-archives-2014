I had something all planned out for this space. It was to be called, “Life Lessons from Candy Crush” and
it was to go like this:

 *  Just because someone says you should do something doesn’t mean you should do it.

 *  You may need a little help seeing the obvious.

 *  Don’t worry about the bombs so much. They’ll often take care of themselves.

 *  But if something is obviously ready to explode, take care of that shit.

 *  Occasionally, despite your best efforts, things explode anyway.

 *  Sometimes you’re dealt a crappy hand and there’s nothing you can do about it. Sucks to be
you.

 *  Slow down. Look at the whole picture.

 *  Blowing shit up can be very satisfying.

 *  Get rid of the negative things that keep creeping back into your life (I hate those stupid
chocolates).

 *  A problem may need to be revisited two or three times before it goes away completely.

 *  A good reshuffle can do wonders.

 *  Failed? Retry.

 *  At some point you will run out of lives.

 *  You can ask for help from your friends, but after a while, even the most generous friend will get
annoyed.

 *  Clear all the jelly.

Oh man, I was so proud of myself. You should have seen my smug face. “This is *genius*,” I thought,
advance-counting the glorious shares, retweets and recommends.

Then it occurred to me: I couldn’t possibly be the first person to think of this. Sure enough, there are
61,000 results for the exact phrase, “life lessons from candy crush.” A broader search for “candy crush
lessons” (no quotes) revealed 22.4 million results. 

I was not a genius to the tune of millions.

I was crushed (I didn’t mean to write a pun, but whatever, it’s out there now). I’d spent time on this
idea. I updated a little notebook as I played the game. I refined and added and edited. And none of it
mattered because it'd been done before. A lot. I’m just a unimaginative hack copying the 22 million people
who’d gone before me.

I put this post away and began pondering other ideas.

But I eventually came back to it. Did I really have to toss this post just because it’s been done?
Furthermore, is any thought or story or idea unworthy if it isn’t completely original? I’m pretty
confident the [inventor of Pepsi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Bradham) didn’t subscribe to that
notion. Caleb didn’t say, “Welp, Coca-Cola exists, so I guess I’m out.” Caleb made his own cola, added
more sugar, and ultimately lots of people pledged allegiance to his caramel-colored sludge in the fabled Cola
Wars of the 1980s.

So sure, 22 million people had gone before me, but none of them had expressed exactly what I’d written:

“A good reshuffle can do wonders” = 0 results. 

“But if something is obviously ready to explode, take care of that shit” = 0 results.

“Get rid of the negative things that keep creeping back into your life” = 0 results.

An argument could be made that “Life Lessons from Candy Crush” is a bad idea because it’s stupid, but
not necessarily just because it’s unoriginal. To paraphrase Neil Gaiman, [no one can tell your story like
you can](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445816-start-telling-the-stories-that-only-you-can-tell-because).


So go tell your unoriginal story in your way. It’s okay.

And seriously, those chocolates are the fucking worst.
