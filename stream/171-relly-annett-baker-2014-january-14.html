       <blockquote><p>“I give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it.”</p><p class="align-right">Alice in Wonderland</p></blockquote><p>I am not really one for resolutions – that is to say, it isn’t a moral objection so much as I haven’t got the willpower to keep them – but it is exactly because of this I really need a constant reminder of life beyond ‘Right now, I’d like to eat this chocolate / get back into bed / go hide in my office and check Twitter rather than play a 33rd round of Snakes and Ladders’. For me, this reminder is my One Little Word.</p><p>For a number of years, I have chosen One Little Word to guide me through the year. I got this habit from scrapbooker and memory keeping blogger Ali Edwards, who has written extensively about <a href="http://aliedwards.com/2013/12/one-little-word-2014.html#more-36533">the impact her OLW (One Little Word) has had from year to year</a>.</p><p>In previous years, I have chosen Move, Complete, Light, Happy and Focus. They have reminded me of long term goals and helped me see whether I am getting closer to the top of whichever mountain I want to climb, or pushing me further away. They have guided me to make difficult decisions and to commit to things I’d rather shirk from.</p><p>I have also argued with myself about them. They have shown me a bigger picture – beyond this minute, this hour, this day – and helped me (sometimes) keep myself accountable. In the case of the chocolate / duvet / dodging kid wrangling temptations, I don’t always win against myself but it’s not like I wasn’t told. The same word, and the many meanings of it I have pondered, reverberate in my head.</p><p>I live with them too. Literally in plenty of cases – I often get a custom necklace with my word on early in the year, and I look for quotes and art prints to hang. The last few years have seen me collect inspiration on a Pinterest board dedicated to my word. I also make journal and scrapbook pages to celebrate my successes and document my struggles. It doesn’t quite fit the definition of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baader-Meinhof_phenomenon">Baader-Meinhof phenomenon</a>, but I start to be aware of my word elsewhere in the world too. It takes on a significance I had never considered previously.</p><p>So, what is my OLW for this year? After some consideration, I have chosen Forward. Something I need to be and do, and not be and not do in equal measure. Allow me then to be so forward as to invite you to consider what your One Little Word for 2014 should be. </p>
