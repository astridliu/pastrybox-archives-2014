One day last fall I thought to myself, “Man, it’d be great to generate some recurring monthly income, so
what can I build to make money?”

(Oh, you’ve had that thought, too?)

So I did a workshop with the smart folks at [AgilityFeat](http://agilityfeat.com/forstartups), and we talked
through nine different ideas I thought (a) could make money and (b) I wanted to put my energy into.

We talked about what minimum viable products might look like and early experiments to test markets or demand.
We honed in on one idea, [tougher.me](http://tougher.me/), which CrossFitters like me would someday use to
post their personal records. 

In January, I set out to find/cultivate an audience by creating a playlist a day using Spotify, posting it
to [musicforwods.com](http://musicforwods.com/) (WOD stands for “workout of the day” in CrossFit
lingo), then cross-posting that to [a Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/musicforwods). 

Fourteen weeks in, Music for WODs is about to pass 24K likes on Facebook, while
[tougher.me](http://tougher.me/) is still in a very small beta working toward “viable.”

So here I am with two hobbies, by startup terms (i.e., “Pre-revenue” HA!) — one that’s fun to make,
growing quickly, people are using on a daily basis, and is generating some grocery money through t-shirt
sales. Another is fun to make, and I hope will grow, perhaps with help from the MusicForWODs Facebook
audience.

In the meantime, I field questions from well-meaning folks who want to know if/how I’m making money. “How
are you going to make money?” assumes I have a master plan. I don’t; I have experiments, sure, but the
greatest thing I’ve learned so far is that “follow the fun” — as [Patrick
Smith](https://twitter.com/ptrcksmth) once told me — is a pretty rewarding strategy to start with.

Beyond that, what’s so bad about having a hobby?
