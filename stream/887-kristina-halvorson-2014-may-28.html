       <p>There have been countless women in my life who have counseled, supported, instructed, and inspired me. But, today, I’m not going to write about them.</p><p>I’m going to write about the men.</p><p>In 1993, Michael Dixon selected me out of 100+ applicants for a prestigious internship at a regional theater. He also inspired me to write my first short play, then later commissioned me to write three more.</p><p>In 1997, Tom McCullough and Chuck Rutherford agreed to let me essentially run their company of 30 people, despite the fact that I had no formal management training or experience.</p><p>In 1999, Peter Kitchak hired me for my first freelance PR job, despite the fact that I had no freelance—or PR—experience. </p><p>In 2002, Andrew Eklund hired me to do marketing communications for his web agency, which fundamentally changed the trajectory of my career path.</p><p>Also in 2002, Bret Busse and Steve Wallace recruited me to serve on a local interactive marketing association board, which ended up exponentially expanding my professional network, thereby helping me establish my freelance career in web copywriting.</p><p>In 2008, Peter Merholz invited me to come speak at his agency Adaptive Path in San Francisco, despite the fact that I was a complete unknown quantity. This eventually led to Jeffrey Zeldman inviting me to write for A List Apart; and then, in 2009, to speak at An Event Apart. These events irrevocably changed my life.</p><p>In 2009, Michael Nolan offered me a contract to write <em>Content Strategy for the Web.</em></p><p>It goes on from there. Now, I’m a successful woman in business with a high national industry profile. Don’t get me wrong—for the past 20 years, I’ve done pretty damn well on my own. But I recognize that men provided several of the pivotal opportunities in my career. Men with influence. Men with power. Men who opened doors, who gave me countless opportunities to screw up and succeed. </p><p>If you’re a man with influence and power, <em>actively</em> <em>use it to empower women</em>. Look around. Listen. Get in touch with your own unconscious biases. Go out of your way to identify and recruit all the smart, driven women who surround you. You can’t shed privilege, but you can spread opportunity. </p><p>The #yesallwomen stories I’ve read this past week have been … I don’t have words. The rage I feel towards the perpetrators of sexual harassment is blinding and exhausting. But it doesn’t keep me from wanting to celebrate the good guys. And my hope is that, in celebrating the good guys, we recognize our shared moral responsibility to join their ranks: to actively, doggedly, tirelessly pursue a workplace that’s safe and equal for women everywhere.</p>
