    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>Remember the time that pretty much anyone who made a website was dubbed ‘<em>Webmaster</em>’? Over the last 20 years we’ve figured out more about how to work with the web but then things move on and we find ourselves in this loop between feeling close to understanding and being out of our depth playing catch-up with progress. A single job title doesn’t really encompass what all of us do in creating for the web.</p><p>Inevitably, as roles diversified we ended up with two main camps: <em>web designers</em> & <em>developers</em>. As we attempted to better our craft, we found that UX was crucial, and that within development there were specialisms typically grouped as being back-end (responsible primarily for the server-side work) and front-end (the stuff you see in the browser). Perhaps it’s a facet of a maturing industry to see specialism emerging.</p><p>As someone who has been in around front-end development for a fair while, you notice how differently people perceive what someone in a front-end role does. This specialism alone has grown to include a wide range of tasks, processes and tools as we in effect bridge the gap between user experience and server side logic.</p><p>Maybe we feel more affinity with design? Maybe we consider ourselves to be more of an engineer? What’s expected of us can vary. In reality, we often need to understand a lot about these related mindsets. We need to know about content, colour, typography, and how people will use what we create as much as we might need to comprehend about logic, data, automation, deployment and security.</p><p>We have a spectrum of things to be aware of before we’ve even delved into what current thinking is around aspects of what we do; to keep up to date with what it means to be a professional front-end focused developer. Not everyone knows the same things and because of this raft of subjects we need to know or at least be aware of, sometimes we lean more towards one side than the other.</p><p>Maybe you’re happier in HTML & CSS than Javascript? Maybe you love automation tools like Grunt or Gulp and Javascript frameworks? Maybe it’s attention to detail over your typography or over whether you’ve written unit tests for your code that gets you going?</p><p>It feels that we have a time where a front-end role can mean different things to different people, which can make it difficult to recruit for. I’ve seen some job adverts listing server-side technologies such as Ruby or PHP as part of the requirements; others where rapid prototyping and working with UX or the design team might be what’s required. Some people might fit the bill for both but not everyone.</p><p>Too generic a job title and you may miss or fail to recognise skills people in your team have, too specific a title and a person may be too hard to replace.</p><p>Do we need to be more specific with how we label front-end developers or are we at the point of needing more descriptive job titles once again?</p><p>Javascript now plays a massive role in modern sites, from the likes of jQuery through to Node.js. Knowing Javascript alone can mean many things. Do you dabble to make things happen or do you really understand the language? As there’s been an increased demand for Javascript, does that mean all front-enders need to up their game in this regard or accept that some might specialise more in Javascript and frameworks while you might be happier with more lightweight code?</p><p>CSS itself can swallow all your attention as you get on board with varying ways of creative flexible, responsive sites or maybe work with a CMS that doesn’t give you the freedom you need. Maybe you want to try out writing OOCSS or a naming convention like SMACSS or BEM. Yup, even the way you name your classes and structure your code can be demanding.</p><p>We need to be flexible and adapt but people always have aspects that suit their nature better than others. As developers know we always need to learn but there is a breadth of what we can chose to learn about.</p><blockquote>What is a front-end developer? Where do you or your team choose to define the remit for such a role?</blockquote><p><strong>For those of you more on the design side:</strong> don’t be afraid of Javascript. Learn a little&hellip;then a bit more&hellip;then maybe see jQuery as an option rather than your default. Maybe write a few tests around your code to give you confidence that it works. Maybe a couple of Grunt tasks might help take care of some of the simple recurring tasks or help your site to perform better?</p><p><strong>Those who prefer logic to imagery:</strong> take the time to learn about the basics of design. At even a cursory level read up on grids (symmetrical, asymmetrical, using the golden ration&hellip;it’s interesting stuff), typography (What classifications of typefaces are there? How do they best work together? Why should you care?) and colour theory.</p><p>In reality what we do as front-end developers is all about people. We’re creating the bit that is rendered in the browser that the user experiences. It’s a privileged position and one that will no doubt continue to be challenging and diverse.</p><p>As responsive sites are more or less the norm, all aspects of what we do can be seen in a new light. Performance is a huge issue and one that falls quite heavily in the front-end area of a build. You might feel you’re doing a small site so what does it matter? A few changes could make the world of difference to how people perceive your site. This kind of optimisation can feel more like the engineering side of us.</p><p><em>What should a front-end developer be? What should we be expected to know? Is there are consensus around the answers to these questions?</em></p><p>No doubt we’ll always feel we’re behind the curve as there always seems like more to learn. <strong>That’s OK</strong>. No-one knows it all, but it is hard knowing what people expect of you.</p>
