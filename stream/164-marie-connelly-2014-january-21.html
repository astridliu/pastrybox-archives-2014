       <p>Chris Hadfield has quickly become something of a hero of mine. His book, <em>An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth</em>, is delightful and I highly recommend it.</p><p>In one section, Hadfield talks about his experiences working in teams of astronauts, who (unsurprisingly) make for highly competitive colleagues. He writes, “It’s counterintuitive, but I think it’s true: promoting your colleagues’ interests helps you stay competitive, even in a field where everyone is top-notch.”</p><p>One of the examples Hadfield gives is of a colleague who expresses an interest in learning how to pilot the Soyuz, even though it’s unlikely he’ll <em>ever</em> need this knowledge, and very clear he won’t need it for the specific mission they’re training for. Instead of brushing him off though — Hadfield spends extra time training with his colleague to help him learn these skills.</p><p>This is not, I think, a typical reaction. Hadfield’s response to potential competition from his colleagues isn’t to withhold information that allows him to maintain his status as a specialist — it isn’t even to say, “Sure, learn that on your own time.” His response is, “That’s great — here, let me help.” The way he stays competitive in a field of incredible competitive colleagues is by helping them get better.</p><p>I suspect we can all see how this might be beneficial in the life and death stakes of, you know, <em>space travel</em>, but I think it’s vital for all of us working on the web, too. No, it isn’t rocket science, but we have an opportunity, collectively, to make a huge impact: together, we shape the space where our fellow humans spend an ever increasing portion of their lives.</p><p>We have an obligation to them, to each other, to ourselves, to make that space as good as it can be. We are, as Paul Ford <a href="http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/10-timeframes/">reminds us</a>, entrusted with the incredible responsibility of trillions upon trillions of heartbeats.</p><p>It is tempting to make only our corners of the web shine — to show how much better <em>we</em> are. To keep our little fiefdoms intact. Certainly, there is the potential for short-term glory on this path — you can stand above your colleagues, be lauded for your exceptionalism, and reap the rewards of that success.</p><p>But I think there are more risks to this approach than we sometimes acknowledge. The very definition of a zenith means we can’t be at ours forever. Whatever you do for a living, there will always be someone who has a new perspective, a brilliant idea, or is just hungrier for that glory.</p><p>If we are truly going to make the web as good as it can be, I think part of that means pushing for the collective successes of our colleagues. We learn and grow and advance the web <em>faster</em> when we’re all performing at the top of our game — we’re all motivated to improve when the people around us are getting better all the time.</p><p>By supporting each other, especially those who are newer to the field, we’re ensuring we have great colleagues for years to come.</p><p>The opportunities for us to accomplish great things increase exponentially when we are surrounded by talented, creative people who want to do more. And there are <em>so many</em> great things we all need to accomplish, so root for those you see advancing your field, and do what you can to play a part in that. Push your field forward.</p>
