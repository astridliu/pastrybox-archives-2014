       <p>In 2003 I was at college studying web technology. I was feeling pleased about my newly acquired knowledge of HTML right around the same time my friends started speaking highly of XHTML. I'd spent a lot of time learning HTML and really didn't like the idea of having to change what I had learnt; neither did my college course cover XHTML (despite it being widely used in the web industry at the time -- but that's another story).</p><p>After a few weeks of pretending XHTML didn't exist, my friends nagged me enough to finally spend some time reading about it. It turned out XHTML was very similar to HTML; in fact, my carefully written and validated HTML <em>was</em> XHTML. So proud of my progress, I hadn't spent the time to realise that XHTML was just a stricter way of writing HTML, which I was already doing.</p><p>Today the web industry is saturated with new technologies along with steadfast fans who insist you are "doing it wrong" if you're not using their beloved tools too. Whether you're experienced enough to have since waved goodbye to XHTML or a new comer to the web industry, you've most likely come across this off-putting attitude toward new technologies.</p><p>Before deciding you'll never learn a technology and it'll be of no use to you, consider that many technologies can be learnt very quickly. As I did back in 2003, with just 10 minutes of research you can decide whether that technology will work for you. Even if you choose not to use it, you can still add it to your list of skills and speak confidently about it amongst colleagues or in a job interview.</p><p>Some popular web technologies I've learnt over the last several years with just 10 minutes of research include: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>, <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>, <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html">AMD/Require.js</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/HTML/Canvas">HTML5 Canvas</a>, <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/">JavaScript Source Maps</a>.</p><p>Next time you sit down with your beverage of choice and 10 minutes to spare, pick a technology you've heard good things about and perhaps you'll realise it's easier to learn than you think.</p>
