       <p>I had something all planned out for this space. It was to be called, “Life Lessons from Candy Crush” and it was to go like this:</p><ul><li><p>Just because someone says you should do something doesn’t mean you should do it.</p></li><li><p>You may need a little help seeing the obvious.</p></li><li><p>Don’t worry about the bombs so much. They’ll often take care of themselves.</p></li><li><p>But if something is obviously ready to explode, take care of that shit.</p></li><li><p>Occasionally, despite your best efforts, things explode anyway.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes you’re dealt a crappy hand and there’s nothing you can do about it. Sucks to be you.</p></li><li><p>Slow down. Look at the whole picture.</p></li><li><p>Blowing shit up can be very satisfying.</p></li><li><p>Get rid of the negative things that keep creeping back into your life (I hate those stupid chocolates).</p></li><li><p>A problem may need to be revisited two or three times before it goes away completely.</p></li><li><p>A good reshuffle can do wonders.</p></li><li><p>Failed? Retry.</p></li><li><p>At some point you will run out of lives.</p></li><li><p>You can ask for help from your friends, but after a while, even the most generous friend will get annoyed.</p></li><li><p>Clear all the jelly.</p></li></ul><p>Oh man, I was so proud of myself. You should have seen my smug face. “This is <em>genius</em>,” I thought, advance-counting the glorious shares, retweets and recommends.</p><p>Then it occurred to me: I couldn’t possibly be the first person to think of this. Sure enough, there are 61,000 results for the exact phrase, “life lessons from candy crush.” A broader search for “candy crush lessons” (no quotes) revealed 22.4 million results. </p><p>I was not a genius to the tune of millions.</p><p>I was crushed (I didn’t mean to write a pun, but whatever, it’s out there now). I’d spent time on this idea. I updated a little notebook as I played the game. I refined and added and edited. And none of it mattered because it'd been done before. A lot. I’m just a unimaginative hack copying the 22 million people who’d gone before me.</p><p>I put this post away and began pondering other ideas.</p><p>But I eventually came back to it. Did I really have to toss this post just because it’s been done? Furthermore, is any thought or story or idea unworthy if it isn’t completely original? I’m pretty confident the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Bradham">inventor of Pepsi</a> didn’t subscribe to that notion. Caleb didn’t say, “Welp, Coca-Cola exists, so I guess I’m out.” Caleb made his own cola, added more sugar, and ultimately lots of people pledged allegiance to his caramel-colored sludge in the fabled Cola Wars of the 1980s.</p><p>So sure, 22 million people had gone before me, but none of them had expressed exactly what I’d written:</p><p>“A good reshuffle can do wonders” = 0 results. </p><p>“But if something is obviously ready to explode, take care of that shit” = 0 results.</p><p>“Get rid of the negative things that keep creeping back into your life” = 0 results.</p><p>An argument could be made that “Life Lessons from Candy Crush” is a bad idea because it’s stupid, but not necessarily just because it’s unoriginal. To paraphrase Neil Gaiman, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445816-start-telling-the-stories-that-only-you-can-tell-because">no one can tell your story like you can</a>. </p><p>So go tell your unoriginal story in your way. It’s okay.</p><p>And seriously, those chocolates are the fucking worst.</p>
