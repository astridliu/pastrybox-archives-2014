I used to be a freelance web designer, a jack of all trades who dealt with every aspect of producing a website
from the first client meeting to the launch of the site. This meant I would work through the entire design
& development process alone, working on user research, information architecture, wireframing, visual
design, front end code and development, not to mention managing the project and the occasional nightmarish
server admin task. 

These days this wide range of disciplines are more specialised and unlikely to be undertaken by one person, so
it’s no wonder I suffered from the acute anxiety of knowing that I would never be as good as I wanted to be
in some of these areas. I worked hard for years to get across The Gap, as Ira Glass describes it (here’s a
great video covering
this: [https://vimeo.com/85040589](https://vimeo.com/85040589) — courtesy
of [@frohlockecom](http://twitter.com/frohlockecom)) and enjoyed success with some areas, but other
areas such as visual design and development I felt stuck at a level I was not happy with. 

With such a diverse array of roles I would always suffer from Impostor Syndrome on meeting a new or potential
client, or talking to my peers. A crippling fear of being a pretender about to be found out. Initially I tried
to specialise, to work for design agencies with the skills I was good at, and this helped a little. I focused
on UX and front end, thinking they were my strongest areas but was not happy with just being able to help with
parts of a project, I still wanted to do it all. 

From January 2012 I was no longer a one man band, having
co-founded [fffunction](http://fffunction.co/). In those early days I found an almost instant
benefit of being a “we” rather than a “me”. Previously I found it very hard to talk about and sell
myself — now that I wasn’t selling “me” I could forget about the anxieties. I could talk
about [Adam](http://twitter.com/robeam) being amazing at UX,
and [Pete](http://twitter.com/fatelvis) being one of the best visual designers I’ve seen. By
leaving myself out of the equation altogether I had a newfound confidence in the “we” rather than the
“I”. 

fffunction has grown to a team of 8 and I’m confident that whatever topic surfaces we have someone in
fffunction who can talk about it. Now when I meet new people whether they be new or prospective clients,
friends or people in the web industry, I still have the same feeling that I’m able to promote fffunction far
better than I can promote myself and so I kind of bypass the impostor syndrome by forgetting to talk about
myself. 

I’m afraid I don’t have the solution to get past the impostor syndrome, and still suffer from anxiety in
initial meetings, and the odd pitch scenario we partake in. Specialising helped, collaboration helped and I
think if I had spent more time [learning to
talk](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/fffunction/2014-january-18) about what I did that would have
helped too.
