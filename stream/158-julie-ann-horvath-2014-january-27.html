       <p>I’m about to tell you things you already know but should acknowledge more often.</p><p>The Internet is a beautiful thing.</p><p>In a series of tweets and other small (but big) online interactions that can only be categorized as slightly embarrassing missteps in the right direction, I’ve met humans I look up to and/or have admired from afar, I’ve found <a href="https://github.com/blog/1082-julie-ann-horvath-is-a-githubber">new and exciting career opportunities</a>, made new friends and exchanged plenty-o-gifs with people all over the world, and on my darkest days, I’ve even managed to make a few enemies.</p><p>That said, somehow, I’ve always managed to be myself. I’ve always <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=do%20you">done me</a>. And I can never quite find the humility to be ashamed of that.</p><p>Because of the Internet, the world is so much smaller. Through it we’re all observers, journalists, reporting on what’s going on around us, on the world as we see it. And because it exists, so do we. On the Internet, we all have voices. Sometimes we just have to find them. Don’t ever let anyone make you feel like your voice, on the Internet or otherwise, isn’t valuable.</p><p>The Internet is and always will be what <em>you</em> make it.</p><p>Go out into the Internet and find people like you, or not like like you, but either way find <em>your people</em>. Find people who will point you toward the answers you’re looking for, instead of tearing you down for not having found them yet. </p><p>“Life is about making friends” popped into my stream of consciousness (and also twitter) the other day. And I thought “Why should the Internet be any different?”</p><p>Make some friends. And then build things that the world needs with people you love. People you will certainly meet while being yourself, while “doing you,” while being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyvYslXdAzU">unpolished, unapologetic</a>.</p>
