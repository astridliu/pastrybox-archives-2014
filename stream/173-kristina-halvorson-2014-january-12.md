This is the first thing I’ve published in over a year.

I’m guessing I’m the only baker in The Pastry Box kitchen who can say that.

Believe it or not, I stopped writing simply because I ran out of things to say. I needed to back off, go back
to client work, shut up and learn new stuff. So I did that. And it was good.

Surprisingly, it turns out that you can’t just sit down and flip the writing switch back on. (Not that such
a switch exists in the first place.) (Dammit.)

Sitting here staring at a blank screen, I know I have plenty of topics to tackle. How I’ve changed as a
content strategist. The demise and recovery of my company. Things I’ve decided not to do for my kids. Being
a leader. Giving the worst talk of my life. How we manage screentime in our house. Competing against your
friends for project work. What happens when you change your mind about an idea you’ve been bullish about.
Living in St. Paul. My brief stint as a playwright. The gift of working with people you love.

Thanks to the Pastry Box team for giving me a safe place to get my groove back.
