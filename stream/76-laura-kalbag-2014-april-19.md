There’s something strange about having to write regularly for somebody else. It’s a different feeling from
writing on my own blog. I’ve only been writing this way for the last 9 months, but the pressure of needing
to produce something so often is changing the way I write.

I’m no longer writing because I feel angry or frustrated enough to vent out a blog post. I’m delving into
myself for something worth writing about. Other writers have loads of life experience and stories to tell.
Other writers have lessons to teach and clever metaphors to help you understand the value. I don’t.

Every few weeks when I’m trying to find a little something to write about, I find myself digging harder into
my mind. Regardless of the topic, the insecurities come tumbling out. Am I saying something that sounds
foolish? Am I being naïve? What will my clients think? This is very public… Why have I even chosen to write
about this topic? What has made me think this is valuable or important?

While it might be making me a little bit crazy, it’s also forcing me to examine my motivations. Every time
I’m scrabbling around, trying to pull together half-formed ideas, I’m understanding myself and my actions
a little bit better.

And now I understand why people say that good writers are good thinkers. I’m not good yet, but I’m
definitely more thoughtful.
