       <p>When running workshops for conference speakers, my favourite thing to ask them is: What are you most afraid of? Answers will vary, and while some worries may seem silly they are for the most part well-founded. Worries about getting bad feedback, forgetting what to say, struggling with a second language, even worries about falling over (actually I worry about this one a lot myself!). I focus on preparing well enough to be able to handle the problems, spending lots of time working with speakers on connecting to projectors, testing slides, how to use a microphone, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>As an experienced conference speaker myself, I have probably spent weeks or months of my life trying to be prepared enough to avoid the things I’m worried about. I worry about wearing the wrong thing, having the talk start late or end early, getting a question that I can’t handle, pitching the session incorrectly, getting negative feedback ... on and on. I buy new outfits, practice talks almost until I can give them in my sleep, show up hours early on the day, ask friends to ask questions on the topic for me to practice answering. I’m not even sure I could answer my own question about what I am really afraid of.</p><p>Last year, two of those fears came true in spectacular fashion at different events. Everything I had worked so hard for, failed. And do you know what happened next? Nothing at all. The sky did not fall in, the universe did not implode. I won’t give those talks again, or probably be invited back to those conferences, but life did actually go on. I’ll still prepare thoroughly because that’s the kind of person I am, but I’m trying to let go of being afraid.</p>
