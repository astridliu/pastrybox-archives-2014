       <p>Few postmortems are truly productive.</p><p>A productive postmortem needs to be where you have the hard discussions. The ones that should encourage change. The ones where you talk about what needs to be better as much as you talk about how great it is.</p><p>I never understood why people felt the need to have a meeting to hash over a project, well after the project was done. By the time you get to this meeting, you have likely forgotten most of the pain points. And pain points are not always some big huge issue. They are the little things. Little things add up. Little things can make or break something. Little things are what gets forgotten long after they have happened, but they get added to an issue pile that grows and grows and then becomes impossible to discuss because it has lost all context and definition.</p><p>What renders a postmortem useless, is timing. Why wait for the end of a project to discuss problems and improvements?</p><p>End each week with a little postmortem. Talk about what went right. Talk about what went wrong. Talk about the challenges faced and how to address them differently â€“ and not on the next project, but on this one. Apply your learnings now, rather than saving them up for a rainy day where you still have your rose coloured glasses on and pats on the back are handed out a dime a dozen.</p><p>It is not about making you better, as much as it is making the work better. If you do it after the fact, only one thing can benefit from improvement.</p>
