       <p>It’s easy to make jokes about how unemployable you are when you’ve been a freelancer for so long. As our own bosses, nobody tells us freelancers what to do. Therefore, we often like to paint ourselves as rebels: we’d be terrible in an office because we don’t like authority and we like to do everything our own way.</p><p>Freelancers might excel at collaboration with clients and their teams, but project work is usually short and sweet. I love working with clients for long periods of time, and repeatedly. But let’s be realistic, we know these client relationships are never going to be a full-time commitment. Freelancers aren’t having to maintain these long-term relationships face-to-face every day.</p><p>Recently I’d been talking to people about how I wanted to collaborate more. I feel like I could level up my design skills by working with others, understanding their angles and goals, and make a project better than one person could ever make it.</p><p>And then I started working part-time in a team.</p><p>And, as it turns out, I’ve become a bit of a control freak.</p><p>I love working with other people, but I’m way too invested in my own way of doing everything. I’m argumentative and very capable of justifying my point until everyone (including me) is bored and wants to go home.</p><p>Working in client services, for myself and by myself, hasn’t made me as good at collaborating with my peers as I’d hoped. Actually, I’m quite scared that I’m terrible at it.</p><p>Still, I’m glad I’ve only left it 5 years before working as part of a real in-the-office-together team. It <em>will</em> make me a better designer. I can feel it happening already as I learn to distinguish the bigger picture from the details, and the battles worth fighting from the compromises worth taking.  It’s easy to make jokes about being unemployable when you’ve been a freelancer for so long, but make sure you haven’t also made yourself incapable of collaborating.</p>
