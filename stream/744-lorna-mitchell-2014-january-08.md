In my professional life, I strive to continuously improve my skills.  Which isn’t to say that I’m great at
everything, but that I’m conscious of the need to inch forward in new directions.  Originally I was a
software developer and while today I also write, teach, speak and consult, I still consider myself an expert
in a pretty narrow discipline.  In a one-person company, you turn your hand to whatever needs doing; I “get
by” in the fields that I’m not so comfortable in, and projects get delivered.

Until now.

Right now, I’m working on a bigger project, with other people.  I’m remembering that there is nothing in
the world so good as good people to make good work.  On my left, the frontend developer who doesn’t write
server-side code but will send me “make this HTML happen” messages, and then make the result come alive in
a delightful, intuitive way for the user.  And on my right, the sysadmins who really understand the care and
feeding of a great setup, and who know not only how to do everything I ask, but also how to rescue me from
things I didn’t even know were a problem.

This project has had the benefit of all kinds of experts, and it’s a better project as a result.  Best of
all, I’ve had the pleasure of working with those experts.  They inspire me — to strive to be at their
level, but in my own field, and to always try to improve at what I do.
