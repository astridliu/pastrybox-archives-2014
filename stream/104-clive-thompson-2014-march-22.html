       <p>Back in the 1800s when typewriters were first being invented, the creators realized they had a problem: People liked to type more quickly than the machines could handle. You’d start cranking away on a letter, and get on a roll. But the letters on those early machines were laid out alphabetically, so you’d try to type two letters in succession that were right next to one another — and the machine would jam.</p><p>In 1867, the American inventor Christopher Latham Sholes hit upon a clever solution. He analyzed word-letter frequency and laid out the keys so the most common two-letter combos were spaced far apart. The result: The QWERTY keyboard layout.&nbsp;</p><p>QWERTY slowed down the human typewriter, because it forced us to move our fingers more frequently, in often awkward ways. (Vowels are common letters, yet the only one on the QWERTY “home row” keys is the <i>a</i>.) But it was a sort of cyborg compromise. You slowed the humans down so that the clunky machines could keep pace. Since it prevented jams, the overall rate of typing sped up.</p><p>Decades later, the quality of mechanic typewriters rose dramatically, so jams were less of an issue, and typing speed rose. Then came electric typewriters in the 1960s — like IBM’s famous “Selectric” — that sped along even faster yet; old-school jams were impossible because the letters were slammed down via a rotating ball. I’m old enough to remember typing on one of those things, and I could race along pretty spiffily, doing about 40 or 50 WPM, making the sound of a Gatling gun. Then in the 80s I started typing on computers. With no moving parts other than the keys, I started flying along at 70 WPM.</p><p>By this time, QWERTY had outlived its purpose. The machine didn’t need to be slowed down any more. If anything, it was possible for the human to speed up. That would require rearranging the keys — and in fact, the “Dvorak” keyboard layout, invented by August Dvorak, arranged the letters so that the ones we type most often are in the home row. This requires 63% less finger movement, allowing you to go faster with less finger strain. It was a brilliant invention, and a superb response to the evolution of typing machines.&nbsp;</p><p>But it was never adopted. Why?</p><p>Because of “path dependence” — the way that decisions from the past lay down ruts that guide our behavior in the future. Once QWERTY was established, it proved to be a hard habit to break.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, think of the economic risk in deviating from the familiar QWERTY layout. Who’s going to make the first typewriter with some weird new format? Nobody’s gonna buy <i>that</i>. And culturally, if QWERTY is what we see around us, it’s what we learn, regardless of whether there’s a better way to do it. Technically, there’s nothing stopping me from switching to Dvorak right now. It’s just a matter of changing one setting on my computer. But I’d have to relearn an old habit, and I’m kind of lazy … so QWERTY it is, and QWERTY it remains.&nbsp;Dvorak died in 1975 <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/1997/apr/thecurseofqwerty1099/#.UyyaaK1dUaA">“a bitter man,”</a> as Jared Diamond writes.</p><p>The path dependence that Sholes laid down is amazingly resistant to change, when you think about it. Look at your smartphone: It doesn’t even have a physical keyboard, so technically it could have any layout. And given the ergonomics of two-thumbed typing, there’s probably some layout that would be far more comfortable and smooth-going. But nope. We use QWERTY on our phones, too.</p><p>In one sense, QWERTY is a cautionary tale. We live with the bones of old decisions. <i>Beware what paths we set out on, people! We’ll be hiking down them for a long time! We better watch out! </i>That’s advice that applies on every level — technologically, emotionally, economically, societally, spiritually.&nbsp;</p><p>But every once in a while the path loops back on itself.&nbsp;</p><p>In my job, I’ve recently started reading a lot of nonfiction on my Kindle Touch. I’m a note-taking freak; when I read on paper, I always have a pencil at hand to jot down marginalia. So with the Kindle Touch I behave the same way. Whenever a passage provokes an interesting thought, I pull up the on-screen keyboard and start pecking away.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kindle Touch keyboard is pretty crappy, though. It’s very inaccurate at detecting where my fingers are touching, and with such a slow processor it’s erratically responsive. So I’ll find myself hitting the wrong keys, or typing the same key twice, or missing a key, and making tons of errors and cursing like a sailor and getting annoyed.<i> Oh well</i>, I’ll tell myself. <i>I guess I should just type more slowly. &nbsp;</i></p><p>Nearly 150 years after Sholes, I’m still wrestling with a machine that can’t keep up with the typist.&nbsp;</p><p>I suppose I’ll need QWERTY a bit longer.</p>
