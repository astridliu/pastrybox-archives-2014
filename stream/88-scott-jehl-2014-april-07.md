It has been a complicated couple of weeks for our industry. With no intention of trivializing
matters, I’ll try and start this week on a light note.

[Here is some footage of a sea turtle making its way to the Gulf of
Mexico](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151833658299491&set=vb.613660398647325&type=2&theater),

Have a nice week. Maybe spend some time outside, yeah?
