Do you have an itch that you keep meaning to scratch? An idea that just won’t go away but life keeps getting
in the way?

As hard as you might try you’re never able to carve out enough time to move things forwards?

Welcome to the very non-exclusive club.

I’m sorry to be the one to break this to you but acts of `$deity` notwithstanding you’re *always* going to
be busy with work / business / family / hobby / health / whatever. There is no pixie waiting to come along and
sprinkle his or her magic dust to help you free up the time.

You’re going to have to make the time.

You could go to bed an hour earlier so you can wake up an hour earlier, work on it in your lunch hour, drop
your hours to 4 days a week, hire a junior or a PA and outsource some of your workload to them. These or a
multitude of other options that you might think up are going to help you start getting your thing done.

It’s your new habit. Give it 10 minutes today, 20 minutes tomorrow and a few hours over the weekend. By the
end of the month you might be able to give it a day a fortnight or if you really are that busy and it wasn’t
just Game of Thrones getting in the way then at least stick to the hour here or there and keep moving things
forward.

My challenge to you — and to me — is to stop making excuses and just crack on with things. Sure you need
to do due diligence before making any life altering decisions, but don’t let making those decisions be put
off indefinitely due to the rest of life getting in the way.

Just Start Doing It.
