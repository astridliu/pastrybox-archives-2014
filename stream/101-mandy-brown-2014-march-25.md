The creators of an app [fail to consider](https://medium.com/bullshit-detector/53135aded229) how it could be
used to harm. A founder implements significant changes to community tools [with little thought given to the
consequences](https://medium.com/p/8a36de59cf10). Thousands of entrepreneurs and investors contribute to the
creation of an advertising model that collects enormous quantities of data on users but apparently [never
imagine how that data could be
abused](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/us-tech-giants-knew-nsa-data-collection-rajesh-de).
Organizations declare an end to “structure” without asking themselves [how power is exercised absent such
systems](http://cbracy.tumblr.com/post/79876957198/the-github-debacle-and-why-holacracy-is-bullshit). Others
claim they operate in a meritocracy without, it seems, ever really wondering [what such a world would even
look like](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/you-keep-using-that-word/).

Here’s a very simple method: when you set out to make something, whether it be software or policies or
mechanisms for organizing information, ask yourself what’s the worst that could happen. Imagine a powerful
person, someone endowed with the right circumstances of birth such that the odds are nearly always in their
favor; and imagine, also, the reverse—someone for whom discrimination, oppression, violence, and poverty are
commonplace. Then optimize to protect the latter, even at the expense of the former. And do it right away: not
after you scale, not after the money is rolling in, not after a leak exposes you, but *now*. Yesterday, even.
*Go.*
