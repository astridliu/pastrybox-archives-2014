       <p>Something distressing happened the other day. Someone I know on Twitter made an April Fool’s joke about leaving the internet and tech work. Of course, there’s some distress just in seeing something like that, because if you’ve had similar thoughts you would probably recognize it as not a haha-funny joke, but a haha-only-serious joke. More distressing to me, though, were the reactions that seemed to suggest you only have a right to talk about leaving if you’re in the process of doing it or have already done it. </p><p>It’s probable that people leave this industry for all sorts of different reasons. But I think it’s equally likely that those reasons really boil down to the same thing. Someone almost ready to give up due to the recent events at Mozilla is grappling with feelings I, as a person who is neither queer nor a Mozillian, don’t have to feel. But the feeling of being fundamentally unwanted by, let’s face it, what’s often less a profession and more a community is a feeling I know very well.</p><p>There were a lot of kind responses to the tweets I saw, as well. People said please don’t, and people said they were sad but understood. I hate to say this, but even those responses contributed to the distress. Where are we for each other before it’s too late, and how do we show each other we’re valued before, alone, others decide they are valueless in our eyes?</p><p>Other responses suggested that to discuss leaving in any circumstances other than the final, dire circumstance of actually doing it was to pour salt in an open wound. That may be true. The wound doesn’t belong to only one person or disenfranchised group, though. There are probably people you interact with all the time struggling with the same thing, and we very certainly don’t heal it by separating ourselves into those finding the bravery to stay one more day and those who were finally too tired, and only allowing the latter group to acknowledge that thing we share.</p><p>Leaving a profession after years or decades because of ugly events within the community, lack of support within the workplace, and the erosion of conviction caused by a constant drip of microaggressions isn’t a decision we should force people to come to alone. It’s a kind of vulnerability that seems to terrify us. I watch people who confess to doubt be moved from the “technologists” column to the “social critics” column, I watch as we all stop listening to them and wait, smug and pitying, for the other shoe to drop. This sucks a lot. Tech workers are entitled to their humanity. They’re entitled to cry wolf, even, if it means we get a chance to fix the problems they’re facing before the wolf is actually at our collective door.</p>
