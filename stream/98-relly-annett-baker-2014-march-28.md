 I wrote before about how I reached a point where I felt like I had to take control of my adult life.
That I had done okay sliding about, relying on serendipity and a willingness to push my luck, but I wasn’t
really doing the best I could at anything. And in climbing higher and higher, I was relying on a crumbling
foundation of dreams and wishes to support my increasingly spindly tower, further and further away from the
aspects of my work and my life that I’m good at and/or want to get better at.

Sometime late last year, I woke up to an inbox full of things I should be doing, a child going off to a school
I really didn’t like, another child getting piles of homework even though he was just four, the rough notes
and plans for three separate books, and a backlog of things I wanted to be doing. I was in a house I rent for
a hideous amount of money, in a city I barely got to explore, living with a family I barely got to see. And I
desperately wanted for that not to be the case.

I stared at the ceiling for almost a whole morning, thinking about the mess I was in and that I could never
dig myself out from it. I cried. I wrote lists. I cried again. And then I realised that it wasn’t that I had
gone wrong. It was that my priorities and goals had changed over time. The more I learned about myself, the
more I wanted to control my future a little. Who I was when I was 18, 21, 25, 28, 30, 33 were all subtly
different and that would continue. I felt like I had grasped, loosely, a secret of adulthood.

When I had my first child at 25, I was desperate not to be a stay-at-home mother. I found it boring, and
frightening, and I didn’t want to be judged. I remember a conversation where two twenty-something guys in a
coffee shop sat next to me and my buggy, presumably to do some Serious Business, and one spoke under his
breath about ‘breeders taking up space’. It stuck with me. I felt compelled to work as much as
possible.

I grabbed at the chance to be a copy writer and then a content strategist. I enjoyed the opportunities it
afforded me to travel solo — something I was too afraid (and broke!) to do as a student or twenty-something.
I met amazing people who loved words on the web as much as I do. I had a good support network with my husband
and a full-time nanny. I was a working woman. 

But over time I had begun to realise that there were problems brewing at home. I barely saw my husband, my
eldest child was not settling well at school (and we had tried a few schools, as we had moved), and I was
resenting the time I spent doing work because I felt I should be at home. I was resenting the time I was at
home because I felt work opportunities were slipping by and I wasn’t doing a good job handling what I had
already. 

I spent much of January questioning my assumptions about what I ‘had to do’. My biggest issue was
education for my two boys. After a lot of reading and research, I decided to stop client work and instead
[home educate my children](http://www.foxesinboxes.com/why-are-we-home-educating/). I would continue to create
and teach classes and workshops, on the side, because that was what I really wanted to do with my career. As
part of that, I started to read a lot about learning and education which fed my ideas about home ed. Early in
February, I took my eldest out and by the beginning of March his younger brother joined him too.

This has, obviously, had a huge impact on our lives — and my work/life balance in particular. I’m still
adjusting, as are the boys. As an added bonus, I have developed a keen interest in learning and how the brain
retains and uses information. I feel like some new areas of exploration are opening up to me, that will help
me create more classes.  It finally feels like I’m going in the right direction, forward.
