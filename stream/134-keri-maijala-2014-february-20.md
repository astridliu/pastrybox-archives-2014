I was an independent consultant for a little over three years. I loved it. I loved the variety, the freedom,
and the daily outfits of hoodies and yoga pants. Even so, I decided to jump back into the world of full-time
employment.

It wasn’t about the money. I have the good fortune of being in a discipline full of lovely, kind people who
often sent referrals, so I was getting plenty of work.

But I missed the daily collaboration with other content strategists and user experience professionals. And
after three years of working (and living) solo, I sometimes found myself looking up at 2 PM on a Thursday and
realizing I hadn't left the house all week. 

“This,” I thought, “is not healthy.”

But returning to full-time work seemed like I was broadcasting failure. Being my own boss was appealing to
everyone else. So *sexy*. Why in the world would I give it up?

Around this time I was asked to interview with two big-name companies. Joining one of these companies would
make sense. It would certainly create the sexy narrative I longed for.

So I labored on the assignments they gave me, confidently presented my work, and had one-on-one discussions
with lots of people. And though my experience varied from person to person, the overall feeling I got was,
“Impress us.”

And sure, that’s part of any interview process, especially at a big name. But shouldn’t any successful
relationship be mutually beneficial? Shouldn’t there be a conversation about what I wanted as well? At one
point I asked an interviewer, “How will you interact with this position?” and was told, “I’m not going
to talk about that right now.” I was floored.

During all of this, I was consulting for a little-known company in Sunnyvale. The woman who hired me was an
adored former boss, and her team was made up of smart, talented women. They were tackling interesting problems
and I had fun working with them.

Sunnyvale wanted me full time. 

 “*Unsexxxxxxxxxy*,” my brain hissed. After years of trying to build my career with big names and the
“glamour” of working for myself, would it look like I was settling? “But this is a great team,” I
thought. “The work is super interesting. I’ll get to build a brand from the ground up. When does anyone
get to do that in an established company?”

*“Unnnnnnsexxxxxxxxxxy*,” my brain insisted. Taking this job meant I would need to repeat my company name
and explain what we do. There would be no envious looks. No one clambering to talk to me at meetups or
conferences. A steeper hill to climb to get a speaking engagement. 

But in contrast to the big names, Sunnyvale was working really hard to make sure this was a good fit all
around. They rewrote the job description to better match my interests and skills. They took my salary
requirements to heart. They were cool with me starting *five months later* to accommodate my living
arrangements and travel plans. 

Meanwhile, from the big names, I got a turn-down and a never-heard-from-again. The rejection from the first
left me heartbroken and confused, but I was relieved about number two. I knew it wasn’t a good fit, but I
might have accepted because of the sheer sexiness.

Sunnyvale was still batting their not-bedroom eyes at me.

With no-gos from the sexy twins, I worried even more that taking the Sunnyvale job would look like I had no
other options. 

But I *did* have other options. Lots of them. I could keep consulting. I could talk to other companies. I
could maybe try again with the big-name heartbreaker. 

Sunnyvale continued to serenade me in sandals and black socks.

And you know, it felt good. No, it felt fantastic. And I realized that making a decision based on
“sexy” or how it would appear to other people is a spectacularly bad idea. This was a great company with a
great team making me a great offer. And honestly, who did I think I was that I assumed anyone would give a
shit about my career?

Sexy is wonderful. Nothing wrong with it. But it alone can’t sustain a relationship. 

I accepted the offer. It was, without a doubt, the right decision. Because sexy is as sexy does.

And damn, I’m feeling *sexxxxxxxxxxxy*.
