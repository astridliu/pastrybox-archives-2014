“Do you have any kids?”

“Nope.”

“Don’t worry. There is lots of time for you to find someone and start a family still”. 

Or another variation:

“I am sure she wouldn’t mind putting in the extra time because she doesn’t have a family”. 

FULL STOP. 

What? I mean, what? 

I do not have kids. Some might call me barren. Some might call me a spinster. No one calls me a cat lady, not
yet, at least not to my face in daylight because they are kind and smart individuals. 

Everyone makes the assumption that I want what they want — what society wants. When these things are said,
they assume that the only family worth having is one that you spent hours pushing out. People assume I can
have what they have. They assume I want what they want. Maybe my parts are completely busted and broken. Maybe
I have spent years trying, or spent years trying to adopt. Maybe I am just not interested. Maybe I am more
than enough of a child to consider dealing with any more.

The definition of family and having one is too tightly tied to procreation. I have a family. Some are
relatives and they are mine whether I like them or not. Some are amazing people that I’ve been lucky to
consider good friends. I would do anything for these people. I am there for the good moments and there for the
bad. I watch them grow and see myself growing alongside of them.They are my family and I didn’t push them
out of anything, I just keep them near to everything.

Nothing is worse than the assumption that I am less than you just because I don’t have what you have or want
what you want. Our families might define us, but we need to re-define them.
