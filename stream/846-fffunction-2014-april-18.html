    <div class="thought-content">
       <p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">I used to be a freelance web designer, a jack of all trades who dealt with every aspect of producing a website from the first client meeting to the launch of the site. This meant I would work through the entire design &amp; development process alone, working on user research, information architecture, wireframing, visual design, front end code and development, not to mention managing the project and the occasional nightmarish server admin task.&nbsp;</span></p><p>These days this wide range of disciplines are more specialised and unlikely to be undertaken by one person, so it’s no wonder I suffered from the acute anxiety of knowing that I would never be as good as I wanted to be in some of these areas. I worked hard for years to get across The Gap, as Ira Glass describes it (here’s a great video covering this:&nbsp;<a href="https://vimeo.com/85040589">https://vimeo.com/85040589</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/frohlockecom">@frohlockecom</a>)&nbsp;and enjoyed success with some areas, but other areas such as visual design and development I felt stuck at a level I was not happy with.&nbsp;</p><p>With such a diverse array of roles I would always suffer from Impostor Syndrome on meeting a new or potential client, or talking to my peers. A crippling fear of being a pretender about to be found out. Initially I tried to specialise, to work for design agencies with the skills I was good at, and this helped a little. I focused on UX and front end, thinking they were my strongest areas but was not happy with just being able to help with parts of a project, I still wanted to do it all.&nbsp;</p><p>From January 2012 I was no longer a one man band, having co-founded&nbsp;<a href="http://fffunction.co/">fffunction</a>.&nbsp;In those early days I found an almost instant benefit of being a “we” rather than a “me”. Previously I found it very hard to talk about and sell myself — now that I wasn’t selling “me” I could forget about the anxieties. I could talk about&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/robeam">Adam</a>&nbsp;being amazing at UX, and&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/fatelvis">Pete</a>&nbsp;being one of the best visual designers I’ve seen. By leaving myself out of the equation altogether I had a newfound confidence in the “we” rather than the “I”.&nbsp;</p><p>fffunction has grown to a team of 8 and I’m confident that whatever topic surfaces we have someone in fffunction who can talk about it. Now when I meet new people whether they be new or prospective clients, friends or people in the web industry, I still have the same feeling that I’m able to promote fffunction far better than I can promote myself and so I kind of bypass the impostor syndrome by forgetting to talk about myself.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m afraid I don’t have the solution to get past the impostor syndrome, and still suffer from anxiety in initial meetings, and the odd pitch scenario we partake in. Specialising helped, collaboration helped and I think if I had spent more time&nbsp;<a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/fffunction/2014-january-18" class="mappr">learning to talk</a>&nbsp;about what I did that would have helped too.</p><p><i>By Ben Coleman - <a href="http://twitter.com/bencoleman">@bencoleman</a></i></p>
