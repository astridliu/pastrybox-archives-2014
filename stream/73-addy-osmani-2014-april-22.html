       <p>“The first draft of anything is shit.” — Ernest Hemingway</p><p>My earliest experiences writing technical articles for the web were pretty atrocious. Years before I wrote any books, I was an engineering student. I lacked writing experience, had impostor syndrome and my resume was a YouTube video of me doing the Macarena for 12 minutes. This could probably have been enough to get me into the White House, but made it difficult to know where to start in the world of authoring articles around programming.</p><p>One of the biggest mistakes I made early on was not seeking outside advice on what I was writing. Technical reviews, regardless of how critical, are an essential litmus test for content you intend on sharing with the world. That cannot be stressed enough. <strong>Imagine if Guns N’ Roses were writing Paradise City today and didn’t get a sanity check before releasing new songs? We’d end up with “Take me down to the hipster city where the grass is green and the girls don’t even”. No one wants that.</strong> At least, I hope not.</p><p>When I began writing, I drew inspiration from popular tech blogs at the time and so <strong>my titles would look like “I Learned How To Write Clickbait Titles. What I Learned May Amaze You”</strong><em>.</em>&nbsp;Or equally as Pulitzer prize worthy, “50 Ways To Do This One Thing. You Don’t Need 48 Of Them But Sssh”.&nbsp;It’s been a few years since and I’ve attempted to correct my ways but titles and post structure remain a difficult beast to get right. Go overly academic and your audience may not read what you have to say; go too click-baity and you’ll feel dirty and likely lose the respect of those that would prefer you being more direct. It’s best to keep your titles short, sweet and to the point where possible.</p><p>Another challenge I ran into was grammar and attempting to reduce the complexity of what I was saying. If the average person can appreciate at a high-level the gist of your article, you’ve done something right. This is probably unfeasible for a lot of technical content that requires context, but keep in mind that lowering the barrier of understanding is generally useful. I mean, it’s not like the English language is evolving at great speed. <strong>Now that “twerking” and “selfie” are in the Oxford dictionary, we can probably return to beating our chests and hitting things to communicate.</strong></p><p>Pictures. We should talk about pictures. Lacking sufficient context to write about some topics in detail, I would follow suit from other tech bloggers and try littering images and screenshots between my text to balance them out. Ooof. That was bad. The problem with this is that visuals should be used liberally and only when they add to the overall message you’re trying to convey. They shouldn’t be used “just because”. <strong>Pro-tip: Don’t post screenshots of your phone if your battery percentage is low. It’s hard for people to focus on the picture because your low battery stresses them out and basically makes you the worst person ever.</strong></p><p>Next tip, <strong>be careful on escalators. I once tripped and fell down the stairs for two and a half hours</strong>. Perhaps that tip should have been, “keep it relevant”. You would be surprised just how easy it is to go off on a tangent when your goal is to get across a few succinct points. &nbsp;</p><p>I could fill pages with the mistakes I’ve made over the years trying to improve my technical writing skills. The last tip I’ll share today is to check your facts and always cite your sources for data. For example, interesting fact — <strong>80% of people inside VIM have no idea how they got there or how to get out</strong>. We all assume that has to be true, but if this was a real piece of technical writing, the source of this data should be fact checked and cited.</p><p>So, in closing, go write something!&nbsp;Sit down at the keyboard and you put one word after another until its done.&nbsp;Don’t be afraid to share your thoughts and experience with the world. We need good technical content out there and although you’ll undoubtedly make mistakes, we all do.</p>
