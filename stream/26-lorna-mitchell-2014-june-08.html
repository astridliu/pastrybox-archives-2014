       <p>I recently gave a keynote entitled “Your Open Source Persona” which revolved around the idea that open source communities give karma on merit, but that with that karma comes a responsibility to consider how you relate to the people inside and outside the project you are now part of. In the course of preparing the talk, I tried to illustrate a point about how well diverse teams perform.</p><p>The problem with science is that you can set out to prove one thing, and end up believing something entirely new. In this case, I found <a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2009/philipsresearch.aspx">this study</a> about having groups of people try solving a problem. Once the group was set up and had started working on a problem, a new person was added to the group. Some of these newcomers were similar to the existing group demographics, but others were “outsiders”. Whether that person was a social match for the group or not had two very interesting outcomes.</p><p>The first outcome was that an outsider being added was more likely to result in a good solution to the problem.</p><p>The second outcome was the surprise. Teams with an outsider (someone who wasn’t a social match for the rest of the group) performed better, <b>but rated themselves as performing much less well</b>. Think about that. Diversity means being with people who aren’t like us, who may not agree with us or may not share our assumptions about the world.</p><p>The best performing teams think that they’re not performing well at all.</p>
