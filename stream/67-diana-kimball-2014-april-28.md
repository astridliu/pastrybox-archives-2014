Visit any site where people share their work—[Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com/discover) for creative
projects of all kinds, [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/search) for music and audio,
[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/categories) for video, [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots?timeframe=week) for
design—the list goes on. Next, fall down the rabbit hole. Keep clicking until you find something that stuns
you, made by someone who seems like they’re just starting out. Then, post about the project publicly, with a
note about what struck you. Include the person’s handle so that they’ll see it, too.

At the very least, the person will smile. At best, you’ll give someone their big break. The approbation of
strangers is holy; never underestimate how much yours could mean.

*I shared the story of my own big break and what it meant to me in [a talk I gave last
year](http://blog.dianakimball.com/post/52720879925).*

*To solve for the other side of the equation—making yourself yourself findable in the first place—I
recommend [Austin Kleon](http://twitter.com/austinkleon)’s new book,* [Show Your
Work!](http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)
