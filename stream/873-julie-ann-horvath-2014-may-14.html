       <p>I recently spoke on a <a href="http://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a> panel about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking">Design Thinking</a>, during which an audience member asked an awesome question...</p><p>“Do you use Design Thinking in your day to day life? And if so, how?”</p><p>This immediately reminded me of a sketch I had drawn in my notebook a few months prior to speaking on this panel.</p><figure><img class="img-lazy" id="6eeb50276b7b45fca8903f08787a8a0d" alt="Screenshot 2014-05-13 00.24.35.png"></figure><p>Pictured above is a poorly drawn illustration of my “heart”. The pieces carved out and aptly labeled are the things and people that are most important to me. They give me a reason to fight for the things I believe in, for The Way Things Should Be™. They're my drive, my passion, and the things and people I want to be closer to and surround myself with.</p><p>It's cliche, but life does move <em>really</em> quickly. We get caught up in the motion of our day to day routines and forget to take a step back and reflect on who we are and how we've grown.</p><p>Sometimes we just need a reminder of what we're living <em>for</em>.</p><p>So, I challenge you to take a moment (right now) and jot down what these things are for you. When you're struggling to keep your head above water or you just need a reminder of who you are, you'll have a neat little list or drawing in that fancy notebook of yours to remind you. </p><p>Pro-tip: If you're forgetful (like me), set a few calendar reminders in both the near and distant future to remind you to check-in with yourself, with the things that make you <em>you</em>.</p>
