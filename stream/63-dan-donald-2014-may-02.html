       <p>I’ve recently left the BBC after two years. I got to work on some great projects with some fantastic, talented people. Reflecting on my time there, what stands out is the culture. Hearing my colleague&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/jameshd">@jameshd</a>&nbsp;do a lightning talk&nbsp;about it at one of my&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/speaktheweb">Speak the Web</a>&nbsp;events really served to remind me how&nbsp;important it was for us.</p><p>All I know is the experience I had in my team who work on the web and apps in&nbsp;<a href="http://bbc.co.uk/sport">Sport</a>, I can’t comment on anyone else’s experiences. I started at the BBC at&nbsp;<a href="/">MediaCity</a>&nbsp;just&nbsp;before the London 2012 Olympics and got to see behind this huge&nbsp;project. There were people in London and Salford covering the web side of it. It amazed me that everyone appeared calm and most notably seemed to take their appropriate level of responsibility, never seeming overawed or visibly stressed by it, which compared to some agencies I’d seen and heard about, was a very different view on how things could be done.</p><p>I loved the lack of blame culture I’d witnessed elsewhere. People make mistakes. We’re human and even with the best hopes and skills, things can sometimes go wrong. It felt very much like a real sense of shared responsibility and a case that the team will find a solution to the problem; after all, building for the web isn’t getting any easier! It’s not whether mistakes are made but how you collectively deal with them if and when they do. The lack of finger pointing, I believe, leads to an environment where people might feel more able to admit to an error so it can be dealt with. By knowing it's OK to say when you're unsure of have doubts over a piece of work gives the team something that can be addressed.</p><p>It didn’t matter what your level was, we could express an opinion or put forward ideas about the product, code or design and feel our views were respected. We had a real sense of collective responsibility for the work we did. We’d push each other on, could take feedback well (and there were times through code reviews where real debates were had over approaches used) because the culture and personality of the team could sustain it. We could take criticism because we knew definitively how it was intended — to make what we put out on the web better and never anything personal.</p><p>As we were often reminded by our guv'nor, it was all about the way people treated each other, with respect and good communication, that made it a great place to work. He was totally right about that. We all felt valued and part of something bigger than our own pieces of work, no difference made through gender, race or sexuality. We all just wanted to make the best possible product.</p><p>I know this might read as a massive promo piece for the BBC but it’s only to give context to the things I’ve found valuable. These few things might seem like they must surely be present everywhere but anecdotally, I realise that’s not the case. It was a fantastic example of how the culture of a company or team makes a world of difference. Of course the quality of output of any web agency or team is what they’re judged by externally.</p><p>People talk a lot about culture, which often seems to be in a start-up context. It's true of all organisations. How we treat each other and how a team works together can’t be underestimated. We can plan what values we’d like to see but ultimately it’s individual's actions that make an internal culture work. Being around people that weren’t ‘too cool for school’, leveraging seniority or trying to outdo each other in a genuinely supportive environment was something to be treasured. As the team grew, I like to think we always made people feel welcome and showed them through our actions how the team’s values should be propagated.</p><p>What I hope for moving on is that I can try and keep a bit of this with me and maybe help spread this kind of environment around. From time to time, maybe I’ll read this back to remind myself of the things I found so good about that experience. I wondered how I'd adapt to working within such a massive organisation after being freelance but because of the people, because of the culture it wasn't only easy to adjust to but difficult to leave.</p>
