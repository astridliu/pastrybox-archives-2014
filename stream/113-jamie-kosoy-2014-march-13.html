       <p>Not more than 5 minutes ago a friend working for another agency asked me for help. He’s the CEO of his company — a much larger agency than mine and definitely not a programmer at all. He was concerned about integrating Tumblr posts onto the home page of a project his team was working on and they were having some issues pulling as much content as possible in. He and his team were curious as to how I would approach the problem.</p><p>Here’s what I wrote back:</p><blockquote><p>I haven’t prototyped or tested with this but just going on what I’m reading here’s what I tried.</p><p><strong>RSS Feed</strong></p><p>The downside is it appears to be static: It only updates when there’s a new post. It’s probably limited to like… around 20 posts or so. I couldn’t find a way to say… get an RSS feed with 100 items, or the second page.</p><p>Examples:<a href="/">http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com/rss</a></p><p><a href="/">http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com/rss?start=2&amp;num=1&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href="/">http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com/rss?num=1</a></p><p>All seem to return the same data. ¡No bueno!</p><p><strong>Tumblr API</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>(doc page:&nbsp;<a href="/">http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v1#api_read</a>)</p><p>This doesn’t seem to require an access token or an app, so there’s no real downside as far as I can see for loading stuff in. The format returned is different than RSS (XML or JSON), but then there’s more control. Examples:</p><p><a href="/">http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com/api/read/json&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href="/">http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com/api/read/json?num=1&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href="/">http://howtobuildanapp.tumblr.com/api/read/json?num=1&amp;start=2</a></p><p>You don’t need to be a code expert to tell you’re getting different data on each of those links. Different data means you can load in more stuff.</p><p>I haven’t prototyped or tested with this so I don’t know how far back the data goes — if you had 5 years worth of Tumblr posts it’s not out of the question that perhaps not all the data is accessible. I’d recommended the dev team over there do more thorough tests to discern that.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Sounds like the dev team is using the RSS feed. I’d switch to using the Tumblr API — there appears to be no con or penalty whatsoever — you don’t even need to create a Tumblr Developer account. If it were me, I’d load in the first X number of posts (let’s say 20). Then a user could trigger more via some kind of interaction — scrolling to the bottom of the page, clicking a “More” button, whatever. </p><p>Further I’d recommended caching responses for a week or so to reduce the # of requests sent to Tumblr, depending on how often the clients’ blog would update and assuming that’s not an outright violation of Tumblr TOS. That might result in the data getting slightly out of sync but also be far less stressful on Tumblr’s servers. I don’t know exactly what “caching strategy” I’d use because well, it’s not my project. :)</p><p>J</p></blockquote><p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">You might think this is more information than the CEO needs. You also might think that I spent an egregious amount of time researching all of this. And if you’ve ever gotten an email from a friend asking for a bit of help like this, you may have put off responding while you took care of other more important (read: paid) work.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>To that I say:</p><ul><li>There are links for him to click and see for himself the differences between one approach and the other. There is research for his team to go off of and a recommendation or two to decide the best course of action.</li><li>The whole of this research took about 10 minutes. It may not be exhaustively researched but it’s an account of what I tried.</li><li>Unless I’m doing something that truly demands all of my time helping a friend out is always a worthy priority. Maybe I can’t respond to everybody the instant they need me but I can at least find the time to respond with something helpful.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Last month <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com">Brad Frost</a> wrote <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-january-28" class="mappr">“Just”</a> right here on this site. Brad’s right, and I’d add that explaining things well goes far beyond code and pixels. Helping others make sense of something you understand is extraordinarily valuable — maybe the most valuable skill of all. It’s the difference between the people around you feeling <strong>empowered</strong> to make decisions and being <strong>subjugated </strong><b>by what they don’t understand</b>.</p><p>Designers should be teaching engineers more about color and typography and the decision making process. CEOs can always be more transparent about the business decisions driving the direction of a company. And coders… well, I think Brad covered that pretty well.</p><p>Take the time to explain stuff you understand to others that don’t. Empathize. Ask for better explanations for things you don’t understand yourself. Be helpful and allow yourself to be helped. Only good can come from that.</p><p>*Oh, and if anyone out there reading this better understands the Tumblr API feel free to ping me with your thoughts. I’d love to learn more.</p>
