       <p>I like beer. I used to drink bad beer in volume when I was a college jerk, but I prefer to drink really good beer in smaller quantities now that I’m a refined gentleman.</p><p>If you asked me what my favorite brewery is, that’s easy. It’s Delaware’s Dogfish Head. Founded in 1995, Dogfish Head is inventive — they age dark brown ales in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEciC3Q5k14">giant Paraguayan wood tanks</a>, they created a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmPrg1pq1x8">homegrown device called Randall</a> to infuse their beers with other ingredients on the fly, and they have a giant <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/company/tangents/steampunk-treehouse.htm">steampunk tree house</a> on the grounds of their brewery.</p><p>While all of that stuff is super cool, I appreciate something else about them even more — the spirit of collaboration they foster for their industry. A good old you-show-me-yours and I’ll-show-you-mine way of doing business.</p><h2>Collaborating to Compete</h2><p>Dogfish Head’s Founder and President Sam Calagione knows what his industry is up against. Despite the fact that there were over 2,500 craft breweries in the United States in 2013 (compared to only 78 back in 1976, according to the <a href="http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/business-tools/craft-brewing-statistics/number-of-breweries">Brewer’s Association</a>), and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhuyghe/2014/01/14/what-suntory-beam-can-learn-from-craft-beer-entrepreneurs/">craft beer production has grown 71% in just six years</a>, the mountain craft brewers must climb is significant. Just two mass brewers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI) and SABMiller, control 75% of the worldwide market, and ABI and SABMiller control 39% and 29% of the United States beer market, respectively. That means that U.S. craft brewers have to scratch and claw to maintain and grow their 32% slice of the pie.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, Dogfish Head and other brewing companies like Sierra Nevada, Allagash, Stone, New Belgium, Avery, and Brooklyn (to name a few) have openly, willingly, and enthusiastically collaborated with their competitors. The Street’s Jason Notte <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/11997284/1/9-great-collaborative-beers.html">surfaces the likely genesis of this sharing attitude:</a></p><blockquote><p>While ultimately a bunch of individual businesses that have to look out for their own interests, [breweries] tend to share similar stories of origin, growing pains, distribution obstacles, legal and legislative pitfalls and struggles for shelf space. There are a whole lot of shared interests and goals between them, but that results in the occasional shared recipe as well.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, they aren’t precious about all of their secrets, because it makes no sense to be. They purposefully work together, because they realize the collective brainpower they harness and put into action will serve to increase their market share and tip the scales more quickly than going it alone.</p><p>Smart.</p><p>At the end of the day, beer is comprised of four main ingredients: water, yeast, malt, and hops. Beer is beer. A brewery differentiates itself by creating unique twists on beer styles, changing their business strategies, and creating lasting relationships. Dogfish Head has experienced fifteen years of double-digit growth. They are expanding their capacity and distribution, and they are further diversifying their business into <a href="http://www.eataly.com/birreria/">large-scale partnerships</a>, <a href="http://www.dogfish.com/community/blogfish/members/justin-williams/the-dogfish-inn-lets-spend-the-night-together.htm">hospitality</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/69022105">food products</a>. I’m confident Sam Calagione’s collaborative spirit had more than just a little to do with this success.</p><h2>Hey, It Worked for Them</h2><p>I am the CEO of a 34-person digital design firm called <a href="http://happycog.com">Happy Cog</a>. I find plenty of inspiration in our industry, but if I had to identify an area in which it sorta smells like bad fish, it’s how we work together to 1) define our collective agenda, and 2) further it. This is where the craft beer industry can teach us all a thing or two. Calagione <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bws2R7Jq7Uo">articulates Dogfish and the craft beer industry’s collaborative philosophy</a> and suggests the tech industry can certainly follow suit.</p><p>Web design is a $20 billion industry in the United States. It grew 4.5% in 2013. While more than 70% of the websites built in the U.S. are built by professionals in client services, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-analysis-design-industry-180000355.html">do-it-yourself website creation companies</a> like Wix (valued at $700 million) and Squarespace are changing the conversation. And while no single web design firm accounts for more than 5.0% of total industry revenue <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb10993697.htm">according to IBISWorld</a>, the full-service heavy hitters like R/GA, Razorfish, Designory, DigitasLBi, and BBDO make it tough for 25-100 person boutique design firms to compete to scale.</p><h2>The Little Agencies That Could</h2><p>I challenge my industry colleagues to pause from viewing your peers as “the competition.” Take a step back and ask yourself, “Is there something I can offer them? Is there something I can learn from them?” Yes there is, on both counts — even if your philosophies differ or your industry niches don’t completely align.</p><p>Let’s adjust our thinking from unnecessarily withholding our experiences, processes, and knowledge, to openly sharing ideas that make us all better off. Don’t like RFPs? Let’s collaborate to construct a coordinated, uncompromising stance. Hate it when clients ask for spec work? Let’s adamantly refuse the idea of it together, while educating those who request it in the process. If we work together, we can positively impact our bottom lines and command a stronger voice in our industry.</p><p>Back in July of 2012, while sitting on a bar stool at Philadelphia’s Yards Brewery (I told you I liked beer), I <a href="https://twitter.com/hoyboy/status/228995498302918656">tweeted this:</a><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I am inspired by the US craft brewing industry’s spirit of collaboration. I will bring this to the digital design world. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23watchme&src=hash">#watchme</a></p>— Greg Hoy (@hoyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/hoyboy/statuses/228995498302918656">July 27, 2012</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p><p>Since then, my business partner Greg Storey and I launched <a href="http://ownercamp.com">Owner Camp</a>, a retreat for small to mid-size digital studio owners and professionals who can help them. We share experiences, trade war stories, and forge lasting friendships. It’s the most therapeutic, engaging, and genuinely feel-good experience I’ve ever had working in this industry. This year, we are expanding the idea beyond a bi-annual retreat, in a concerted effort to affect meaningful change for our piece of the industry.</p><p>As I type these last few words, I shall crack open a Dogfish Head Punkin Ale, stashed away to protect it from holiday consumption, dreaming about the industry that could be.</p>
