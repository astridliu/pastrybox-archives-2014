       <p>If you work on the web, you know the work of Eric Meyer. He’s an industry pioneer.</p>

<p>In August of 2013, Eric and I were exchanging messages, trying to find a time for our kids and wives to meet. Both of our families were vacationing at the New Jersey shore, a town apart, as we had in previous years.</p>

<p>Just before we were able to agree on a time and place, Eric messaged me that they needed to rush their middle child Rebecca to a local hospital for intravenous fluid treatment, due to something they couldn’t pinpoint. A virus or strep throat, perhaps. Soon thereafter, she was taken to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, undergoing major surgeries.</p>

<p>On June 6, 2014, Rebecca died of an unrelenting brain tumor. It was her sixth birthday. Losing a loved one is tragic. Losing a six-year-old child is unimaginable and unjust.</p>

<p>Through Eric and his family’s experience, we became witness to the raw emotion of a man going through an impossible journey, via his blog. <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2013/08/page/2/">From his earliest post</a> to the <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/09/in-memoriam-2/">day we lost her</a>, we all felt like we knew her through Eric’s writings. I was immediately struck not only by how open he was, but how elegant a writer he is.</p>

<p>In early April, Eric shared with us the <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/04/04/on-writing/">reasons he chose</a> to publicly share his journey. He wrote for historical documentation, to provide an account for his son, and for giving him the ability to shape something while everything around him had no form.</p>

<p>When I read Eric’s post entitled “<a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/04/03/the-truth/">The Truth</a>,” in which he and his wife Kat discuss Rebecca’s prognosis with her, I uncontrollably sobbed over my lunch in a ramen restaurant. It is the most powerful thing I have read in my 44 years.</p>

<p>I am devastated by their loss. I am particularly sensitive because I have young kids of my own. Amidst the agony he and his family are negotiating (and he continues to document), I would like to thank Eric for showing the world what love and compassion truly are.</p>

<p>Having lost my dad recently, I too continue to grieve. Eric, your words have helped me, more than you know.</p>
