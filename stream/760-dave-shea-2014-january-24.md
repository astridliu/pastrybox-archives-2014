An oddity about right now is that we have some great decentralizing tools that make location basically
irrelevant. Github, Dropbox, and Google Drive née Docs allow collaboration between remote parties, spread out
anywhere on the globe. Routine daily face time with the people who ship alongside you is almost a quaint
idea.

And yet, in the tech industry, we orbit the gravity well of daily events in a single city. The very tools that
allow us to distribute are produced centrally, by and large, in that one place. A rounding error of our
planet’s population resides in its geographical spotlight, and the rest who don’t often seem like an
afterthought. (Until it comes time to monetize.)

It’s a bit strange. Just me?*Most recently inspired by @brendandawes:*
