       <p>I worry about the people who never leave their home countries: they tend to assume that the rest of the world is exactly like their own or — worse — that it’s exactly as someone else has described it to them. They think they understand the world and all of its intricacies, complacent with the way things are.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

<p>How many countries have you visited? How many countries have you lived in? </p>

<p>It’s one thing to visit a country; it’s another thing entirely to live there.</p>

<p>When you visit, you see a country the way you want (or your tour guide wants you) to see it: you visit the tourism-focused sights, laugh a bit at the strange customs, and struggle with the foreign language.</p>

<p>But when you <em>live</em> there, you see a country the way its people see it: you learn about off-the-beaten-path restaurants, struggle with bureaucracy, and discover the complexities of the culture.</p>

<p>By fully immersing yourself in another country, you learn, first-hand, about why people love (and hate) their homelands. And then, upon your return, you see your homeland from the perspective of another. </p>

<p>And you start to realize that it’s not the way you remember it, and that it doesn’t have to be that way. That, in fact, you can (and <em>should</em>) improve it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

<p>Travel. </p>

<p>Look at the world through someone else’s eyes. </p>

<p>And then make the world better, because then you’ll know how.</p>
