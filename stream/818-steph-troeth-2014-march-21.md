“What *are* you doing?” 

My husband was just walking into the kitchen, and caught me with a cookie in one hand and a little brass brush
in the other — the brush that we’d normally use for cleaning root vegetables. How do I explain? Would
it make me seem less sane if I admitted to what I was really doing? 

The reality was I couldn’t let these cookies go looking untidy, so I figured I’d sweep down the sides with
a brush, one cookie at a time, cleaning off those loose crumbs with the same movement that I’d use to smooth
the edges of my hand-wrought silver work. (Do other anal-retentive bakers do this, or is it just me? Maybe
it’s best not to know.) 

Leading up to our first Christmas in the new house, I had that old familiar itch to bake. It had taken us a
long time to get settled, not least because work required the both of us to travel frequently. New habits
take a while to form, new adjustments take time. As a result, the cat was the only one who had his territories
staked out and his routine down pat. 

It’s been about three years since I’d baked batches of anything, other than a brief but extensive study on
apple tarts and one poor attempt at a strawberry shortcake. When we’d lived in Montreal, I’d bake cookies
for my neighbours every now and again. Or rather, I’d bake them, hand most of the batch to my neighbours on
the same day, *and* coerce my husband to take some to work so I wouldn’t be stuck having to eat the
lot. Or any. I enjoyed the baking but dreaded the consuming, thus began a worthwhile symbiotic relationship
with my neighbours who couldn’t refuse a sweet treat.  

After a while, our downstairs neighbour started sending over the occasional gluten-free banana bread, which I
adored. Our upstairs neighbour brought me meals when she knew I was home alone. “Neighbourly bribery",
I'd called it, and it went both ways.

So it’s with fond memories of friends left behind that I bake a new batch of cookies, in a new house, in a
new town, in a new country—my own recipe of ginger and spice geared to give the adult tastebud an indulgent
zing, rather than just a childish sugary crumble in the mouth. 

By some form of irony, it was that failed fling with the strawberry shortcake that changed the way I baked
forever. Based on an idea from the beloved [Nigella](/), under most circumstances I now freeze the butter
then grate it into to the flour. Who needs a cake mixer? Or at least, I’m not getting one until the sad
day I no longer have the strength in my arms to whip a batter with love.  

A small matter of a fallen fence meant our first conversations with the neighbours on one side weren’t
exactly friendly. The ones on the other side work long hours, and we only cross paths when the deliveryman
drops our packages at the wrong address. Maybe it was the desire to smooth over rough edges, to create
circumstance where cordiality can take seed, to engineer the opportunity for something more than the mere
sharing of walls or fences that led to this bout of spontaneous cookie-making. After all, every hand-baked
cookie is a little offering, a tiny step towards a conversation, to getting to know another human being as a
person, a token of perhaps-friendship. 

In the glass jar where the spicy gingerbread men with brush-tidied edges stood patiently waiting, I’d snuck
in some Super Evil Cookies—a sinfully demonic compound with dark and white chocolate chips, fudge,
butterscotch and honeycomb. No, there wasn’t any other appropriate name for them. A handwritten note on a
little festive tag attached to a red ribbon around the jar, and the cookies were set to go, ready to take on
the most steadfast and most staunch.
