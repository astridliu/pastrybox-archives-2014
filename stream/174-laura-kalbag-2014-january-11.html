       <p>A few weeks ago I was listening to <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/106/">The Big Web Show podcast</a> where Jeffrey Zeldman was interviewing Jason Fried. They were discussing business models and how they’re willing to pay for a good product or service if that’s the cost of that product or service’s survival. A concept Jason Fried introduced here was “voting with your money.”</p><p>Voting with your money is something I’d heard before, but not given much thought. We have power in however much money we possess; wherever we spend it, we’re sending the message: “I endorse this. I want more of this to exist.”</p><p>I like to consider myself generally conscientious, but this made me feel a bit guilty for some of my past purchases; particularly cheap consumer goods I’ve bought because the value suited me, even though the production may have been through the sacrifice of others.</p><p>And it’s been stuck in my head, rattling around for those weeks. I think it should apply to the work I do, too. Wherever we look in the world today, we can see people suffering as a result of the greed of others. </p><p>As people who work with the web, we may not often be the people running the businesses or passing the legislation that causes damage, but we should still have an ethical responsibility for the work we are doing. When we’re working for a company, or on a project, that may damage our web, society or world in some way, we need to think about if we’re happy to do that for short-term monetary gain.</p><p>Recently I had this discussion with Andy Clarke on the <a href="http://unfinished.bz/50">Unfinished Business podcast</a>, and still then it felt like my ideas and principles were half-formed. I was left wondering where the line was between working on something that would be harmful to others and something that could indirectly contribute to the harm of others. It’s an area I need to test myself, but I wouldn’t be happy with either.</p><p>The work that we do on the web has a potentially tremendous reach. And with reach comes influence and power. We may just consider ourselves cogs in the much larger machine, but we forget that without any cogs, the machine wouldn’t work. As people who are privileged to seek employment from different potential employers or clients, we can afford to vote with our work.</p><p>Is your next project something you want to endorse? Do you want more of it to exist?</p>
