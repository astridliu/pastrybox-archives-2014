I recently gave a keynote entitled “Your Open Source Persona” which revolved around the idea that open
source communities give karma on merit, but that with that karma comes a responsibility to consider how you
relate to the people inside and outside the project you are now part of. In the course of preparing the talk,
I tried to illustrate a point about how well diverse teams perform.

The problem with science is that you can set out to prove one thing, and end up believing something entirely
new. In this case, I found [this
study](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news_articles/2009/philipsresearch.aspx) about having groups of
people try solving a problem. Once the group was set up and had started working on a problem, a new person was
added to the group. Some of these newcomers were similar to the existing group demographics, but others were
“outsiders”. Whether that person was a social match for the group or not had two very interesting
outcomes.

The first outcome was that an outsider being added was more likely to result in a good solution to the
problem.

The second outcome was the surprise. Teams with an outsider (someone who wasn’t a social match for the rest
of the group) performed better, but rated themselves as performing much less well. Think about that. Diversity
means being with people who aren’t like us, who may not agree with us or may not share our assumptions about
the world.

The best performing teams think that they’re not performing well at all.
