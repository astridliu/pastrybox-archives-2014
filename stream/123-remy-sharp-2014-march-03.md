Personally, when I read these epic, super-deep or super-wide, lengthy, intelligent, well written posts I
sometimes think to myself: shit, I can’t write anything half as epic as that.

So I walk away. I procrastinate. I tell myself *I don’t have anything to share* or *they already know it* or
I find another reason why I shouldn’t write.

But sometimes, it’s just worth crapping out a short post, just to remind myself, even if it’s brief, that
it’s good for me to keep the ball rolling on blogging and posting. It makes me better at written skills and
my communication. It’s a skill that I should keep trying at. Even if the post doesn’t get retweeted or
favourited or reshared or remediumeded or re-what-the-fuck-have-you.

So here’s my post. Short and sweet...ish. A reminder to myself that sometimes simple is good enough.
Where’s yours?
