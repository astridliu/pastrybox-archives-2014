## First Things First and Cathedrals

Last week something great was launched. [First Things First 2014](http://firstthingsfirst2014.org) is a pledge
and a manifesto. It outlines where we, as designers, have abused our skills and used them to promote a society
built on consumerism and manipulation. It explains how we could make better use of our time working on
projects that genuinely benefit other humans, that help solve real problems in “areas such as education,
medicine, privacy and digital security, public awareness and social campaigns, journalism, information design,
and humanitarian aid.” (You should give it a good read, and then sign it too!)

I was lucky to have a sneak peek at the document and make a few suggestions over the last few weeks, and then
see [Cole Peters](http://twitter.com/cole_peters) introduce First Things First 2014 at [Design and
Banter](http://designandbanter.com) in London last Monday. Coincidentally, that night also hosted a fantastic
talk by [Nicklas de León Persson](http://twitter.com/takete) on a similar theme.

Nicklas spoke about how the cathedral-building attitude has been lost. The people who built cathedrals, which
would take a hundred years or more to build, weren’t just building things for quick gratification, but
because they felt part of something bigger and more long-term than themselves. Nicklas was saying that we need
to focus on more sustainable digital products, which should in turn make us consider the value of those
products on the world around us.

## Purpose

After watching these talks, and spending the last couple of months trying to understand the ethics of working
in the tech industry, I serendipitously came across [slashpurpose.org](http://slashpurpose.org) by [Fictive
Kin](http://fictivekin.com/purpose). I had seen [Rushmore’s wonderful purpose
page](http://rushmore.fm/purpose) before, but I hadn’t realised it was part of a bigger
idea:

> …we think the world would be a better place if the people trying to shape it
> spoke openly and plainly about their vision for the future.

That’s cool! Of course I should have a purpose page too! 

But I’m a little different from the majority of the very admirable companies on that page: I’m in client
services. I’ve not got a product and I work on many different products throughout the year, mostly with
startups and small businesses.

“What can a lowly designer do…?” There were numerous questions along these lines at Cole and Nicklas’s
talks. These were mostly from designers working in client services, and from what I could tell, often as part
of an agency. This didn’t feel right to me. Why do so many people feel as though they have no say in the
work they create? In order to pay our rent, do we have to work on projects that could have a lasting negative
effect on the world we live in?

It made me realise that, as a freelancer in complete control of whatever work I take on, I’m in a position
of enormous privilege. Yes, I could make a lot more money if I wanted to take on projects with big evil
corporations, but that wouldn’t make me feel good. I love my job and I don’t want it to just be about
profit.

It also made me realise that, being in such a position, I must make the most of it.

### My purpose

My rough first draft:

 *  Work on projects that are sustainable and have a positive effect on the world around me

 *  Work for the benefit of others, to provide good experiences for users and clients alike

 *  Work hard to provide true value from the money I am paid

 *  Be honest, even if it means I won’t benefit financially

 *  Keep learning and collaborating so I can learn from others

 *  Share as much as possible, try to contribute back to the web community that has taught me so much

 *  Create products that make both me, and my clients, proud

These guidelines are intentionally wooly round the edges. I’m trying to heed the words of [my grandpa’s
thoughts last month](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/laura-kalbag/2014-february-11); principles aren’t
always black and white. Having these guidelines as a purpose gives me something to check myself against. If
all they do is ensure I properly examine my reasons for taking on a project, then they’ll be worthwhile.
