At the beginning of last year I started a new job that would require me to do more coding and programming than
I had done in a really long time. I was scared and nervous. I knew I could do it, I’ve taken many projects
over the years where I had to learn something completely new, but at the same time, I’m so self-critical at
times that I was worried I’d have a rough go of it.

Luckily I work with kind and talented folks who were willing to help. They introduced me to the world of
pairing (I’ve generalized this from [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming),
something I’d done in the past, but never in a formal way), and it’s changed the way I work and the way I
think about work. At first I was terrified; I’ve never had a problem showing my work before it’s done, but
sitting there with someone and having them watch you work, that’s a different beast all together.

Pairing, the way I understand and practice it anyway, is a fairly specific way of working where two people
collaborate in real-time over the work. I suppose it could be any type of work, but I  generally like to think
of it as more involved than say a white-boarding session, for example. It my recent experiences this means
writing code or working in Photoshop with one person “driving” and the other chiming in as needed.

The sessions are generally short and focused on a single problem. This keeps them from being inefficient, and,
in my experience, it’s very productive, often more so than solo work.

When working solo, you don’t have that quick, real-time feedback loop you get with pairing, and that loop is
double-bonus-good if you’re working with someone who you’d need to gather feedback from at a later point
anyway.

Pairing is also a great, amazing, superb way to initiate knowledge transfer, and that transfer works all
ways.

It doesn’t matter your skill level. It might be tempting to think the benefits apply more to inexperienced
folks, but I've found that it works regardless. An experienced veteran can benefit pairing with a young’un,
or someone who doesn’t even have the same skill set.  That second pair of eyes just helps and diversity of
thought is aways an asset to problem-solving.

The benefits of a pairing session, as you might expect, diminish over time or when high-level thinking is
needed. We all need “slack” in our schedule and working alone also has great benefit. For me a bit of
regular pairing, with very specific goals and problems in mind, put into my work schedule is perfect.

Give it a try, I bet you’ll love it.
