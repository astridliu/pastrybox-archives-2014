It’s the beginning of a new year, so like many people I’m feeling a little reflective, and not just about
this past year. The journeys we go through almost always have twists and turns that we didn’t see coming
when we were younger and arguably more idealistic. Bear with me while I’m incredibly self indulgent and talk
about myself for a bit.

At school I only knew I wanted to work with ‘media’ somehow. (This was pre-web.) Later, at college (the
step between high school and university in the UK), I ended up studying film-making and audio recording. Both
used analogue tech and seemed like the kinds of things I could do as a job, though the examples we had in both
spheres seemed incredibly difficult and competitive professionally. We made short films, recorded & mixed
bands and though I loved these things, I was still clueless what I wanted to do with my life.

Before the end of the course, the web hit the mainstream, so we ran up huge bills for the college on the
dial-up connection we had. Seeing the web for the first time made something click: this could help bring the
things I loved together in some way. I saw massive potential in what the web could be but I also missed a
trick. I didn’t understand at that time that the web was always intended to be read/write and encouraged
people to contribute to it. I felt I needed a degree or something to make a site. It didn’t take long to
realise how painfully naive that was.

I went to university on a course called Media, which at interview sounded like what I was already doing at
college with a load of computing knowledge thrown in. It sounded ideal but in reality, it was a computer
science course and it wasn’t right for me at that time. I had no background with maths or programming
(messing about with my old Amstrad CPC464 copying code out of magazines aside). I left after a term feeling
even more clueless than before.

Through the ‘wilderness years’ spent working in a warehouse and attempting to find a direction, I found
that making websites wasn’t what I thought it was; a little time with HTML and figure out the whole FTP
thing then…boom! Website.

After dabbling with being a web designer for a while I felt like there was too much to know, too many
languages and concepts. I wanted to design and make something that really served a purpose but knew only tiny
fragments of code. Everything that required any complexity and I’d have to head to tutorials or use
something open sourced that I didn’t fully understand. Eventually, I went to university as a mature student
to fill in those gaps about what programming is and how to use it. I considered myself on the creative side of
the equation but felt like this experience would open up the choices I had.

I felt like sharing this with you because I didn’t have a sense of direction, the web was young so there
weren’t career paths for working on it laid out. If you’re at school or college yourself and don’t feel
like you have a sense or direction when others around you do, don’t worry. Try and find out what drives you,
what you want to explore more. It might take a while but that’s OK. Because of going to uni later in life, I
appreciate the ability to change if we feel we really want to be doing something else with our lives.

What really helps to emphasise this is my brother, younger by two years who ended up working in the complaints
department for a telecoms company. Not a fun job, I’m sure. While the job went well enough and he got
promoted, it had no relation to what his passions were or using his talents. He’d always been great with
art, music and writing, and hearing people shout down the phone day in, day out was demoralising to say the
least.

Meeting people that ran an advertising course at his local university seemed to trigger that spark in him.
Here was something that allowed some of those creative talents to be used. Pairing with a great creative
partner, the course provided a foundation for some valuable internships. Through perseverance and talent,
they’re now the main creative team at a great agency in London.

I couldn’t be more proud of the change he’s made in his life and what he’s achieved. It’s not been
easy; there have been a lot of hard times, lack of money or place to live, but having something to believe in
is important.

Recently I’ve seen a friend go freelance, have great success and try to push herself through public speaking
& writing; another friend really step outside of her normal sphere of work to open a shop. 

These examples hopefully show that if you’re frustrated with your situation, you can change it. If your job
isn’t satisfying or using the skills you have, you can at least sow the seeds to make some kind of change
— however small. Some changes might require retraining and for a period being worse off, but if we can cope
with that, the payoff can be so worthwhile.

Working in the web industry, we can learn all the time and use our own projects to experiment. We can make
changes to our lives if we want to and follow our passions, wherever they lead us. Think about that this
year…where do your passions lie? What do you really want to be doing?
