       <p>I know that, one way or the other, I’m going to screw up my kids.</p><p>I mean, every parent does—raising children is a messy enterprise, and even the smartest, kindest among us makes mistakes that have a lasting impact on their well-being. I will do something—lots of things—wrong. I already have. Something is already broken. I’m sure of it.</p><p>I’m uncomfortably, hyper-aware of this reality, every minute of every day. I’ll have a difficult interaction with one of the kids, and I’ll wonder, “Is this it? Is this the exchange that seals their future of unhappiness?” I worry about giving them too many options, or saying “yes” too often, which might result in a lifelong attitude of self-entitlement. I lie awake at night worried that I rely too much on their affection and approval—isn’t that codependence? What else am I doing wrong? How badly have I screwed them up already?</p><p>I don’t need anyone to tell me that I have fantastic kids. They’re smart, kindhearted, witty, generous little people. And logically, when I examine the facts, I know that I’m a good mother—or, at least, good enough. But how can I be more? How can I protect myself against their anger and resentment later in life, the kind I felt towards my own parents for so long?</p><p>And there it is. This neurotic, ever-present fear isn’t about potentially damaging my kids’ long-term well-being. It’s about me.</p><p>Acknowledging that has been a tough process. (Ironically, what I kept thinking at first was, “Now they’re going to hate me because I’m a narcissist!” Please be grateful you do not live in my brain.) Lately, my mantra has simply been, “Get out of the way.” I establish guard rails, then try to step aside. Let them walk their own paths. Be the best person I can be. Love them unconditionally.</p><p>Pretty sure that’s good enough.</p>
