I recently spoke on a [Women Who Code](http://www.womenwhocode.com/) panel about [Design
Thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking), during which an audience member asked an awesome
question...

“Do you use Design Thinking in your day to day life? And if so, how?”

This immediately reminded me of a sketch I had drawn in my notebook a few months prior to speaking on this
panel.

Pictured above is a poorly drawn illustration of my “heart”. The pieces carved out and aptly labeled are
the things and people that are most important to me. They give me a reason to fight for the things I believe
in, for The Way Things Should Be™. They're my drive, my passion, and the things and people I want to be
closer to and surround myself with.

It's cliche, but life does move *really* quickly. We get caught up in the motion of our day to day routines
and forget to take a step back and reflect on who we are and how we've grown.

Sometimes we just need a reminder of what we're living *for*.

So, I challenge you to take a moment (right now) and jot down what these things are for you. When you're
struggling to keep your head above water or you just need a reminder of who you are, you'll have a neat little
list or drawing in that fancy notebook of yours to remind you. 

Pro-tip: If you're forgetful (like me), set a few calendar reminders in both the near and distant future to
remind you to check-in with yourself, with the things that make you *you*.
