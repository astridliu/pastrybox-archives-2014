There’s incredible momentum toward the notion that everyone (or at least kids in school) should learn to
code. Take Code.org: Part of the vision is that “computer science should be part of the core curriculum in
education, alongside other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, such as biology,
physics, chemistry and algebra.”

I fundamentally disagree with that idea. Can everyone learn to code? Sure. Does everyone need to?
Maybe… perhaps it’s too early to tell.

I think everyone should learn about art. Better still, everyone should learn about __design__. Imagine classes
with emphasis on critical thinking, collaboration, inspiration, beauty, craftsmanship and creativity. Don’t
those skills sound important? 

Those classes, rare as they are, seem to be going the other way. They’re the ones that disappear when a
budget gets cut.
