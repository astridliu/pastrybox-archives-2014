My [last post](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ariel-waldman/2014-february-13) on the Pastry Box touched on
how I never felt much of a strong affinity for space exploration prior to landing a job at NASA. There is
one exception that I can point to, though. While living in Kansas City, I’d often spend my evenings and
weekends watching documentaries. There really only seemed to be two types that I would become glued to —
deep space exploration and deep sea exploration. My favorite area of space exploration has always been the
very far away things that are at the edge of our understanding — black holes, dark matter, multiverses,
cosmic microwave background, etc. With sea exploration, I have been endlessly fascinated with the multitude of
seemingly weird-yet-amazing creatures exposed in the dark depths of the ocean. While most of my work is
space-based, I’ve been sure to create side projects like [Seahack.org](http://seahack.org) and a
[creepy awesome sea slime](http://www.pinterest.com/arielwaldman/creepy-awesome-sea-slime/) board for fun to
satiate the deep sea creature nerd in me.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, over the years, I’ve found myself geeking out more about extraterrestrials,
extremophiles and astrobiology. To me, it’s a romantic mashup of sea and space that allows my imagination
run wild. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) via radio waves (and hopefully someday soon via
optical pulses) is a depressingly small [effort](https://www.teamseti.org/donate) relative to other
scientific endeavors. To me, it’s one of the most significant. It’s a depressing thought to me, the idea
of many civilizations even within just our own galaxy being sprinkled throughout, unable to contact one
another due to the expanses of spacetime and the minuscule distance covered by our own radio waves (a pathetic
100-200 light years in a galaxy that is a hundred thousand light years in diameter). Each curious about, but
without direct evidence of, each other. I was pondering the other day about what scientific discovery would I
be sad about not having been made yet before I die. It’s a good question to meditate on. The discovery of
extraterrestrial intelligence is hands down number one for
me.![img](https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/e0d881d4a15e0d5846d102e32603fc81/data/img/thoughts/insert/817/-bc502c297d3bc7f5760a1480e31bf4ea-d2dc34ed2c9d1e37e711105f70b75f40.full.jpg)

them even at that distance. Graphic by Adam Grossman and Nick Risinger.

But there are other forms of extraterrestrials that are equally fascinating to think about. The kinds that may
not fit within our current viewpoint on intelligence, but are no less inspiring in their accomplishments. The
tiny, perhaps microbial, extraterrestrials that may not have access to a radio tower or a spaceship, but for
all we know could be relatively abundant within galaxies, and maybe even exist within our own solar system.
This is what astrobiology is — the mashup of biology and space — imagining what forms of life could exist
throughout the universe through the lens of how various creatures have survived on Earth. Extremophiles are a
particular scientific delicacy for many astrobiologists. Extremophiles are creatures on Earth that can survive
in conditions that would kill off most others. Acid, salt, cold, hot, dry, dark — it sounds like a tasting
menu, but these are many of the conditions in which researchers will search for forms of life on Earth and
study how they might be able to survive on other planets and moons with equally inhospitable environments. For
me, this research has two interesting applications: (1) the development of space probes that will know how to
search for life in our solar system and (2) the potential seeding of life in our solar system (e.g.
terraforming Mars). I’ve often talked about my fascination with seeding life in the universe — the failed
Russian attempts to [send tardigrades to Mars’ moon
Phobos](http://blogs.plos.org/takeasdirected/2012/01/15/could-tardigrades-survive-re-entry/) and how certain
types of [lichen could survive on
Mars](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/20120515-earth-life-survive-mars.html), giving other forms of
life a necessary foothold to grow from. In the search for life realm, the debate is heating up over whether to
look for life in the oceans of Europa (Jupiter’s moon) or Enceladus (Saturn’s moon). In an ideal world,
we’d send probes to both, but the reality of funding for space exploration means we’ll be lucky if we get
even one. [This infographic](http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn25355/dn25355-3_1200.jpg)
touches on some of the high level considerations for debating probing one versus another. Europa currently has
a lot of weight behind it partially because it was the first to receive publicity for having an ocean that
could potentially support life, and thus has had a very long head-start over Enceladus, despite us having more
information about the makeup of Enceladus’
ocean.![img](https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/e0d881d4a15e0d5846d102e32603fc81/data/img/thoughts/insert/817/-e204ec284f4e7ce367a80f9fca968c42-e8ae38bd9148c49e9964749901a6cd31.full.jpg)

These fascinations of mine are likely also a result of being friends with [Seth
Shostak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Shostak) and [Chris
McKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McKay). Both are very notable in their field and often appear on
many of the documentaries that I have watched over the years. Seth Shostak is an astronomer at the [SETI
Institute](http://seti.org) who has worked alongside other equally great people such as [Frank
Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake) (of the famous Drake equation), [Jill
Tarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Tarter) (the inspiration for Contact), and [Carl
Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) (of original Cosmos fame). Seth is likely also one of the
most hilarious astronomers you’ll meet. I recommend watching his [presentation about finding
ET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkxEbIxoNQI) from an event I put on with Boing Boing. Chris McKay is an
astrobiologist at NASA who has produced countless papers and conducted tons of field work in Earth’s extreme
environments to better understand how we might find life on Mars. I remember asking Chris how many times he
had been to Antarctica and he said that he had lost count after something like 20! I always love to soak up
Chris’s take on space exploration. Just recently, he shared with me [a great article he
wrote](http://arielwaldman.com/wp-content/2014/03/McKay-2007-AdAstraBioRev.pdf) on how we’ve already
technically contaminated Mars and how we should rethink planetary protection policy for the future of
exploration.![img](https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/e0d881d4a15e0d5846d102e32603fc81/data/img/thoughts/insert/817/-42427dcaa1c39f84b186724747b4f285-11ec10957b20786a08a282bd91f187b3.full.jpg)

I am so grateful each and every day for having discovered my own excitement for science, which has led me to
meet amazing people like Seth and Chris who I can geek out with about the multitude of questions I have. Not
all types of science are interesting to everyone — in my experience, people typically have one or a small
handful of things that make them turn into a puddle of awe. But once you realize what your one science thing
that turns you on is, your mind instantly expands as large as the universe (or multiverse), as if you’ve
injected it with some type of neurological [dark
