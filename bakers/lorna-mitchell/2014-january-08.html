       <p>In my professional life, I strive to continuously improve my skills. Which isn’t to say that I’m great at everything, but that I’m conscious of the need to inch forward in new directions. Originally I was a software developer and while today I also write, teach, speak and consult, I still consider myself an expert in a pretty narrow discipline. In a one-person company, you turn your hand to whatever needs doing; I “get by” in the fields that I’m not so comfortable in, and projects get delivered.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Right now, I’m working on a bigger project, with other people. I’m remembering that there is nothing in the world so good as good people to make good work. On my left, the frontend developer who doesn’t write server-side code but will send me “make this HTML happen” messages, and then make the result come alive in a delightful, intuitive way for the user. And on my right, the sysadmins who really understand the care and feeding of a great setup, and who know not only how to do everything I ask, but also how to rescue me from things I didn’t even know were a problem.</p><p>This project has had the benefit of all kinds of experts, and it’s a better project as a result. Best of all, I’ve had the pleasure of working with those experts. They inspire me — to strive to be at their level, but in my own field, and to always try to improve at what I do.</p>
