In a way, we’re all managers. We burn through what we think are endless reserves of energy to keep companies
alive and prospering.

The thing is, while doing that we forget about the most important company we’re supposed to run —
*ourselves*. We inaccurately equate happiness with amount of success — valuation of a startup, monthly
sales, a round funding, new hires, good PR — chasing the idea of success-bringing-happiness everywhere but
where we can actually find it, within ourselves: 

> “You have to make your own
> happiness, wherever you are. Your job isn’t going to make you happy, your spouse isn’t going to make you
> happy, the weather isn’t going to make you happy… You have to decide what you want, and you have to find
> that way of doing it, whether or not the outside circumstances are going to participate in your success… You
> have to be able to create your own happiness, period. And if you can’t, then you need to find a good shrink
> who can help you figure out what it’s going to take.”*Uncertainty: Turning Fear and Doubt into Fuel for
> Brilliance*, Jonathan Fields

We create a set of conditions that must be fulfilled and expect that, eventually, happiness will magically
unfold. On the way we [burn](http://andrewdumont.me/avoiding-burnout)
[out](http://alistapart.com/article/burnout), face
[depression](http://sd.jtimothyking.com/2009/04/17/depression-and-the-software-developer/), even [attempt
suicide](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html). All of
this because we’ve neglected our own needs for too long. We’ve failed at leadership. We relied on *ifs*
and *whens* that might never happen.

Life will throw unexpected, sad events at you. Even some that feel unbearable. In some cases though, we are
capable of making our own luck and shifting our perspectives to see opportunities, not obstacles. Positivity
is a self-reinforcing and self-fulfilling prophecy, though it can’t work for us if we are constantly focused
on survival alone. 

We can change our thinking by better managing our company — our own thoughts and the voices in our heads.
Those *people* we hire — subconscious personas, saboteurs, or call them as you wish, appear early in our
lives as a built-in mechanism to protect us from the evil, evil world. Defense mechanisms, one would say. Mind
patterns, assumptions, judgmental statements. 

While they work for us when we’re young, helping to keep us safe from harm, they do more damage than good
during adulthood. We still let them do whatever they see fit to defend our own interests. What if they don’t
know what those true interests are? We create hell for ourselves through mismanagement. 

This is when __positive intelligence__ comes in.

Notice when your employees are misguiding you. How about telling your *quality assurance engineer* that he is
being too judgmental? What if *the analyst* is over scrutinising reality? The pessimistic *manager* tells you
you will fail anyway. 

All of those voices need to be heard, labelled as misbehaving workers and dismissed. __FIRE THEM ALL.__

When you’ve effectively laid off everyone who was bringing your company losses — now strengthen your team.
It can be done through accessing *the Sage* — the deeper, rational and wiser part of our brains. It always
remains unbiased and seeks opportunity in every circumstances. It doesn’t judge, it accepts whatever is
given. 

The Sage empowers us to be more empathetic towards ourselves and others, more curious, exploratory,
actionable. It helps let the distress go away, by conscious choice of doing so. It’s nothing less than a
truly positive approach to life. The Gatekeeper of Happiness.

How will you be running your company now?
