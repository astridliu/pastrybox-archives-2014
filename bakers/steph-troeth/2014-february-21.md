It was so cold in the first class cabin on the boat, the windows were frosted over on the inside.

There was a size-able TV playing a science-fiction horror film—“The Thing”—appropriately set in
Antarctica, which merely added to the impression of cold. The DVD kept getting stuck, however, so we saw the
opening scene six times and the ending three times, but not much in between.

We were on the 7:00am express boat from Sibu to Kapit, a remote town in the centre of Borneo that, even today,
can only be reached by light aircraft or by boat. Some 126 kilometres west of Sibu along the Rajang River,
Kapit was once a garrison town founded by Rajah Charles Brooke. Today it serves as an administrative centre
for the division of land roughly covering 40,000 square kilometres in the interior of Sarawak.

These boats which make the trip several times a day are surprisingly long and narrow. You could pay RM20 or 20
Ringgit Malaysia for a regular ride, RM30 for a seat in the second-class cabin or RM35 to be frozen to death
at the front of the boat.

There was an enclosed deck between the front and middle cabins, and this is where I escaped the freezing cabin
to the natural, tropical warmth. They had kept the doors open on either side, and a welcome breeze blew
through the deck. It was still not yet hot, but you get the sense that another humid, steamy day was rousing.
A young man, not much more than 20, stood smoking near the door on the starboard side. I nodded in greeting
and moved towards the other door. We were zipping at a decent speed over the great Rajang River, its water
browned by years of deforestation. So much of the tropical jungle I knew as a child have been converted to
fields of cultivated palm trees, their yield sent to China primarily as cooking oil. It was a clear, sunny
morning, and we whisked past mangrove jungles, punctuated by an occasional river-side village or long-house. I
poked my head back into the cabin, where there was an instant drop of 15 degrees1, and checked that my elderly
grandmother was comfortable and coping okay.

My grandmother was born in Kapit. I had only visited once when I was five years-old, a trip from which only
fragments of disjointed memories remain. This would be my first visit, as it were, as an adult. It was my
father's idea to come back for a day or two, though I hadn’t bargained on the 6-hour drive from Kuching to
Sibu, nor the early start on the boat that he had in mind. 

The boat ride took nearly three and a half hours. When we docked at Kapit, to my astonishment, a couple of
uncles appeared (I found out later) and had their servants haul our luggage away. It was likely that I had
more family concentrated here than anywhere else—my grandmother's brothers, many of their sons, daughters
and grandchildren still lived here—most of whom I had never met.

We had arrived just before lunch. My grandmother was immediately ushered into a local “kopi-tiam” just
beneath our hotel—one of the few in town—to catch up on family news and local gossip. A kopi-tiam, or
“coffee house”, typically comprises an open space with stalls lining the shop walls, serving various local
hawker fare. It is not uncommon to have tables, chairs and dining customers spilling out from the shop onto
the pavement. Sitting in kopi-tiams seems to be the usual pastime for the elderly here: they recount old
stories, remember old gripes, reminisce over old friendships and foretell the future. My father later remarked
to me that Kapit could be a good place to retire in, and I found myself hoping that he wasn’t giving too
much serious consideration to the thought.

I was to discover the traditional pecking order in which returning family members would be greeted in turn,
with meal after meal of steamed local fish and “native” greens stir-fried with garlic: the sons of my
eldest grand-uncle get first dibs at taking us out for lunch, then dinner.

We were picked up by car and driven to an uncle's house. While this doesn’t sound much like anything out of
the ordinary, it’s worth noting that because there are no roads into Kapit, all vehicles have to be brought
upriver by boat. Every car and motorcycle in the town costs much more here than in connected cities like Sibu
or Kuching further down along the river. We drove along a narrow, winding stretch of road, past the local
politician's mansion which loomed on the hill, into what seemed like a new housing development. I had little
time to take in the scenery or to re-orient myself, we seemed to arrive almost immediately after we departed.


The car pulled into a short driveway with blazing white tiles, leading up to a shaded parking spot. My
uncle’s house was a modern concrete terrace affair, complete with fashionable trappings and walls freshly
painted white. I stumbled out of the car and looked around. There were many other similar houses sprouting
here, for those who could afford it. Here, truly, was the beginning of a mini-sprawl. It didn’t look any
different from housing estates one would encounter in other cities in the region, but I did a mental
double-take when I realised the scale and cost involved, remembering that everything here had to be brought
upriver: all the materials, every single tile, every kilogram of concrete. And yet somehow, the lure of a
spacious, modern house and a car or two—social symbols of success—also reign here, just like it does
everywhere else.

My uncle had another guest for lunch, a British military man who served in Sarawak before its independence, a
man whom they affectionately called “The Captain”. He returned to Kapit every year; an impressive man,
considering his age. We sat on Western sofas in the living room, sipping iced green tea sweetened with honey,
in the line of fire of a rotating fan blaring bursts of recycled hot air. My father asked the Captain about
his past life, and they talked about what had happened in the region around the war. I felt like a little girl
once again, not knowing enough of the facts to ask real questions, grasping at straws to understand what the
adults were going on about. I looked at my mother, still sharp and beautiful into her 60s, who calmly smiled
every once in awhile and said very little. What would she be thinking about at times like this? I have never
learned how to be like her, not with my burning curiosity and brash inquisitiveness.

Finally, lunch was served. The Captain, who sat next to me, asked me a little bit about what I do. The
difference in social protocol with a younger generation between the East and West has never ceased to make me
smile. None of my uncles had really cared to ask me any direct questions, except to confirm that I do, indeed,
live in England. After lunch, the Captain rode with us back into town. I inquired about his travels and the
nature of his journey back to Devon, where he lived. He mused about the perils of managing laundry on a long
trip to the tropics. Too soon, we arrived at his lodgings. As he got out of the car, he winked at me, “Well,
I won’t see you in London.” And he was gone.

Early the following morning, my mother and I went around town. Kapit is surprisingly compact, its core being a
matter of a few streets. Shops surround the old square, a common meeting point. Above the shops are typically
living quarters, or, in our case, a small hotel where we had stayed the night. Almost all the buildings are no
longer original, with the exception of two shop-houses on one side of the town square. As the story goes, the
permits to remove them were lost or not processed, so they have never been torn down. They sit snug in between
their taller, modern cousins of clean lines and concrete, shaming them into
blandness.![img](https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/d2b115c660745e6b48901be32734a52d/data/img/thoughts/insert/999/-1102ba8b9a7f57e6e68b157df692f88e-e10f29ba7a523db516d4674a568ea87c.full.jpg)

There is a size-able market, known as *Pasar Teresang*, which served as a commercial focus for the town and
the district. The indigenous people bring their crafts, wares and fresh jungle produce for trading, some of
which would end up downriver in bigger city markets for a much higher price. On a sunny Saturday morning,
everyone flocked to the town centre for shopping, socialising—and most importantly, eating. I wondered how
the shops here survived. Do people make enough to live on? They seemed to. Perhaps this small community,
relatively sheltered from external influences, had reached a comfortable point of internal equilibrium. 

“Would you come back to live here?” I had asked my grandmother when we had a quiet moment together.

“No.” She was firm about it. When I asked why, she didn’t give a direct answer and muttered words along
the lines of “too many people”, “not easy to get around” under her breath. It dawned on me then that
things here must have changed a great deal since her childhood and that this was no longer her home.

I was repacking things in my room when my father knocked on my door and told me that they were going to Fort
Sylvia. The fort was built by Charles Brooke in 1880 to prevent conflicts between the Iban and the Orang Ulu.
The significance of the place was probably more impressive than the artifacts it now housed—it witnessed a
peace-making ceremony between the Iban, Kayan, Kenyah and Kajang peoples in 1924.

While we looking over historical photographs, a small band of European tourists joined us. They were quite
obviously struggling with the heat and humidity. One of them pointed at a large clay urn displayed on the
floor of the room and said to her husband in French, “But that's Chinese!” Presumably, she was
unimpressed. I considered explaining that the Chinese have been here for a very long time, but they were
already filing out the sole doorway. 

Kapit may not be Paris or Geneva, but it was the place where local warring tribes finally made peace.
Ironically, peace isn’t something you can take hold in your hand or point your finger at. Peace isn’t
impressive when you have it, but you would certainly miss it when you don’t.

My greatest surprise2 in Kapit was a peculiar discovery hanging in the shops: backpacks and t-shirts adorned
with Angry Birds, waiting to be sold. Even in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the jungles of Borneo,
Angry Birds, that Finnish mobile game which took the world by storm, had also somehow penetrated here and
became a desired-enough icon to be worn on a shirt. Who would’ve
thought?![img](https://pastrybox.s3.amazonaws.com/d2b115c660745e6b48901be32734a52d/data/img/thoughts/insert/999/-cc69fb70764ec9ec4b89f5a42bdb0adb-73104624ea74300cc5fb30e8464a337f.full.jpg)

A road to Kapit extending from other river towns, Kanowit and Song, has been scheduled for completion by
20153. The locals, who have waited for over 40 long years for the road to be constructed, are not holding
their breaths. For now, the road is a focus of frustration, its delayed arrival feeding the local sense of
“backwardness” compared to other cities and towns in Sarawak.

Back on our boat, on that enclosed deck where we sat to escape the freezing cabin, my father had struck up a
conversation with a man from Kapit who was very knowledgeable about the tribes of Borneo.

“Everyone wants the road, but they don’t know what ‘development’ means,” he said, waving his hand at
the passing mangrove jungles, over the rumble of the engine. Here, the hunger for progress conveniently
overshadows any notion of what might be lost and irretrievable. The road will bring with it easy access to the
outside world, but it will also be the harbinger of the irreversible infusion of change. Modernity comes at a
price: it means being vulnerable to external market demand, playing nice with others, conforming to rules
others dictate.

“People are simple-minded here,” said the man. “I don’t think they really know what is coming.”

Looking closely at the riverbank, you might not always see the long-houses, which tended to sit further back
from the water. But on certain stretches in the region you might notice the long beams of wood cleft into the
hills, slender slivers of grey-brown embedded within deep green; they must have been here for a very long
time. On each of these, if you squinted, you could just make out the carved little steps, left behind by wood
already cut away. Such a genius solution to make steep hills conquerable. And in a way, maybe as the human
race, we have always carved our roads in order to conquer our futures, come what may.

2My other pleasant surprise was that my Kindle Keyboard 3G had no trouble connecting to the Internet. Small
marvels.

3At the time of publication, the road is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
