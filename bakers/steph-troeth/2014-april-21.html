       <p>The sky was already surprisingly bright, I didn’t end up needing the flashlight I’d brought with me. There is a technical name for this particular time—the nautical dawn—when some things are beginning to be distinguishable to the naked eye. Too soon, it would progress into “civil dawn”, when it would be possible to see most things even if the sun hadn’t risen.&nbsp;</p><p><em>How unpoetic</em>, I thought, as I placed one foot in front of the other, following a trail that I now know well. It was cold and slightly windy. I’d beaten the dawn chorus, so it was eerily silent. For a short moment, I questioned the wisdom of having gotten up so early. As I glanced up towards the west, a luscious full moon still hung in the night sky, dutifully watching over those of us still fast asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Two roads diverged in the downs, and I took the one more trodden but with a much steeper rise. Clambering uphill whilst barely awake was an ungraceful endeavour: I felt as if I was constantly stumbling upwards rather than actually walking. It occurred to me that this didn’t feel too different from staggering home drunk after a big night out, my muscles were creaking in protest as my steps felt scarcely steady; and yet, the body learned to adapt fast and my feet seemed to know what they were doing. &nbsp;</p><p>On my left, stood an endless sprawl of tall, yellow canola flowers. An anonymous field of grass spanned to the right, looking grey in the dawn where it would normally be green. I stopped to catch my breath and looked back down at how far I’d come. Checking my watch, I noted the time. It was good, my estimations had been conservative, I’d made reasonable speed. The moon had begun to dip; as it lowered, I climbed. And finally, as the curved crest of the hill flattened out, I knew I had arrived.</p><p>Two days ago, I discovered this spot while walking the other way. The first thing I noticed was an odd tuft of little yellow flowers which were not anything that I could identify. They sprouted just on the one spot in the ground, and it was strange because there was nothing else like it anywhere around for miles. How did it get here? Did its seeds fly and land here by chance, or did someone deliberately plant it here? Next to those yellow flowers was a patch of earth on which no grass had managed to grow. It was calling out for a picnic blanket, except I’d left my little woven grass mat back at the house. Well, then, it would be breakfast on my feet. I reached into my backpack and pulled out a little container of yoghurt and granola.&nbsp;</p><p>The wind wasn’t brutal but it was testing. Taking a sip of hot tea from my flask to keep warm, I glanced around as I waited. It was very quiet, very still, except for the sweeping sounds of the southeasterly gusts. Towards the south, the next town was still steeped in shadow. Northwards was a broken signpost indicating a public footpath that led down the hill on the other side.&nbsp;Someone had left a lost, lone slipper on top of the post—it perched like a roosting plastic animal.&nbsp;</p><p>The unseen sun had begun to paint the eastern sky in shades of pinks, oranges and yellows. A few clouds drifted nonchalantly, going nowhere. Then when the moon discretely disappeared over the edge of the western horizon, there were a few precious minutes of in-betweenness. The true twilight, the point between night and day, where one could no longer see the moon and not yet the sun. I marvelled at the fluidity of the motion, the simple lack of fuss. Then again, it had been this way for many a millennia, who was I to be surprised?</p><p>The sunrise began to turn everything gold. I tipped my flask eastwards and drank to the new day. Stamping life back into my cold feet, I started down the path to the north, taking the long way home.</p><p>The next morning, I did it all again; this time with an extra vest and a hat, and that woven grass mat. At the top of the hill, it was a little less cold being closer to the ground. Someone had knocked the slipper off its perch on top of the post, it sat a few metres away on the frosted grass. Today, there was a fine layer of fog and more cloud to the west, so the moon feigned invisibility, only peeking out here and there as it began its nightly descent. Today, the sky was more conservative with its colours as the sun rose, with light blues and shades of salmon. It struck me then, that no sunrise was like any other, and that every day was truly a new day.</p>
