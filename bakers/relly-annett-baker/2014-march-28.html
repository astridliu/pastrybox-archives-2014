       <p>&nbsp;I wrote before about how I reached a point where I felt like I had to take control of my adult life. That I had done okay sliding about, relying on serendipity and a willingness to push my luck, but I wasn’t really doing the best I could at anything. And in climbing higher and higher, I was relying on a crumbling foundation of dreams and wishes to support my increasingly spindly tower, further and further away from the aspects of my work and my life that I’m good at and/or want to get better at.</p><p>Sometime late last year, I woke up to an inbox full of things I should be doing, a child going off to a school I really didn’t like, another child getting piles of homework even though he was just four, the rough notes and plans for three separate books, and a backlog of things I wanted to be doing. I was in a house I rent for a hideous amount of money, in a city I barely got to explore, living with a family I barely got to see. And I desperately wanted for that not to be the case.</p><p>I stared at the ceiling for almost a whole morning, thinking about the mess I was in and that I could never dig myself out from it. I cried. I wrote lists. I cried again. And then I realised that it wasn’t that I had gone wrong. It was that my priorities and goals had changed over time. The more I learned about myself, the more I wanted to control my future a little. Who I was when I was 18, 21, 25, 28, 30, 33 were all subtly different and that would continue. I felt like I had grasped, loosely, a secret of adulthood.</p><p>When I had my first child at 25, I was desperate not to be a stay-at-home mother. I found it boring, and frightening, and I didn’t want to be judged. I remember a conversation where two twenty-something guys in a coffee shop sat next to me and my buggy, presumably to do some Serious Business, and one spoke under his breath about ‘breeders taking up space’. It stuck with me. I felt compelled to work as much as possible.</p><p>I grabbed at the chance to be a copy writer and then a content strategist. I enjoyed the opportunities it afforded me to travel solo — something I was too afraid (and broke!) to do as a student or twenty-something. I met amazing people who loved words on the web as much as I do. I had a good support network with my husband and a full-time nanny. I was a working woman.&nbsp;</p><p>But over time I had begun to realise that there were problems brewing at home. I barely saw my husband, my eldest child was not settling well at school (and we had tried a few schools, as we had moved), and I was resenting the time I spent doing work because I felt I should be at home. I was resenting the time I was at home because I felt work opportunities were slipping by and I wasn’t doing a good job handling what I had already.&nbsp;</p><p>I spent much of January questioning my assumptions about what I ‘had to do’. My biggest issue was education for my two boys. After a lot of reading and research, I decided to stop client work and instead <a href="http://www.foxesinboxes.com/why-are-we-home-educating/">home educate my children</a>. I would continue to create and teach classes and workshops, on the side, because that was what I really wanted to do with my career. As part of that, I started to read a lot about learning and education which fed my ideas about home ed. Early in February, I took my eldest out and by the beginning of March his younger brother joined him too.</p><p>This has, obviously, had a huge impact on our lives — and my work/life balance in particular. I’m still adjusting, as are the boys. As an added bonus, I have developed a keen interest in learning and how the brain retains and uses information. I feel like some new areas of exploration are opening up to me, that will help me create more classes.&nbsp; It finally feels like I’m going in the right direction, forward.</p>
