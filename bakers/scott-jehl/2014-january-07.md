At some point in 2013, I started surfing. Well okay, *surfing* doesn’t really describe *whatever that is*
that I’m doing out there in the water… “not-drowning,” “panic-swearing,”
“[pearl-diving](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/xFCwMhYLp5E/maxresdefault.jpg)” are all a bit more pertinent. I’m
not *good*, is what I’m getting at, and the prospect of that changing soon isn’t very good either. For
one, the northwest stretch of Florida coastline I now call home is not exactly known as an exemplar of
consistent wave conditions. What’s more, surfing is perhaps unsurprisingly the lowest priority thing I do,
long after I finish [making websites](http://filamentgroup.com), spending time with my wife and baby daughter,
doing household chores, [writing about
websites](http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design), etc., etc.

But damned if I don’t love being out there when I get the chance. Stripped of the campy ways in which
surfing is typically marketed to us, it’s hard to think of a purer, more independent, mentally and
physically challenging, environmentally sustainable, and often [starkly beautiful](http://vimeo.com/78293038)
activity to invest time into. And heck, learning something genuinely new, a bit scary, and thankfully
un-tethered to a screen in my 30s feels profoundly refreshing.

Winter has set in here, which in north-Florida terms doesn’t mean the season is over, but just that I’ll
be donning a wetsuit to ward off some chillier conditions whenever I get the chance to venture out. One day a
week or so ago, it was 39°F outside with a water temperature of 61°. The waves were up for the third day in
a row, and when they’re up around here, you try to take advantage. I got off work, snatched my wetsuit off
the clothesline outside, and cringed as I slid one foot into the cold, spongey, still-soggy-from-2-days-ago
neoprene. I briefly reconsidered the idea of paddling out at all, but a thought occurred to me that maybe
putting on an already-wet wetsuit could be framed as a sort of goal, rather than the minor deterrent that it
was. As the thinking went, if I’m putting on a wet wetsuit, I must have done a few things right that week; I
balanced my priorities well enough to find time for this low-priority thing I enjoy, a thing that makes me
feel alive (*and nearly not, at times — see pearl diving, above*), and repeatedly at that.

Look, if you came here for a “disruptive,” mind-blowing epiphany, I’m sorry — this one may not have a
lot of legs.

But here’s the thing. Many of us builders of the web have little trouble finding inspiration to do more
work; it’s the *getting-away-to-do-seemingly-unimportant-things* part that many of us struggle with. And
yet, those things really are pretty important… for sanity, for fitness, for perspective, or at least to
recharge for another round of the obviously-important stuff. Perhaps your unimportant-on-paper activity is
experimenting in the kitchen, restoring a motorcycle, or heck, building the websites you can’t build during
work hours. If I’ve observed anything at work (and particularly from maintaining our own portfolio website),
if you don’t consider your lowest priority to-dos important, they have a way of never happening.

And so, while I’ve never been much for New Year’s resolutions, for 2014, here’s a simple one that’s
been working for me so far: I’ll aim to keep my wetsuit wet.
