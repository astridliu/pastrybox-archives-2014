Recently, I attended a local event here in New York City. It was a rather typical affair: colleagues and peers
all rubbing elbows in the repetitive humdrum affair of networking. There was one conversation I had, however,
that dare I say will sit with me for the rest of my life. I heard a phrase that I had never heard before, but
one that I have tried to practice my entire career: __[intellectual
honesty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_honesty)__

>   
> Harvard ethicist Louis M. Guenin describes the “kernel” of intellectual honesty to be “a virtuous
> disposition to eschew deception when given an incentive for
> deception.”[(1)](http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short)

This method of problem solving is characterized by “an unbiased, honest attitude” in the face of
overwhelming incentives to skew the world in our favor. This disposition was discussed in Wiener’s 1964
paper entitled *“Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary Scientist”.* Going forward he perceived science
to be less an individual act and more of a group one. This “intellectual corporation”, as Wiener put it,
was not always guaranteed “to do great work”:

>   
> There’s another illusion that the more papers are being published, the more science is being done. However,
> a large number of *bad* papers means less science is being done.    
> —[Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary
> Scientist](http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short)

If this army of scientists producing potentially bad science wasn’t enough there was a further risk that the
correct scientific truths would be purposefully ignored because they were unpopular, misunderstood or worst of
all: pushed forward by unpopular people. 

This has been the case for many giants whose shoulders we stand on today: scientists who persisted even though
their ideas were considered laughable or if they themselves were prejudiced against. All of their
contributions are now considered truths, facts, and laws. 

Looking for some examples? Let’s consider two. First, [Cecilia
Payne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin#Doctorate) (the first woman to earn a Ph.D. from
Harvard) spent four years from 1925 to 1929 doubting her thesis *“Stellar Atmospheres, A Contribution to the
Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars”* because she was dissuaded by her
dissertation reviewer, [Henry Norris Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell). __Today it
is considered to be one of the most brilliant Ph.D. theses ever written in astronomy.__

Second, in 1838 Michael Faraday first suggested that electromagnetic forces as fields that surround objects
with such properties. This foundational scientific truth was largely ignored by the scientific community. *But
Faraday persisted,* and almost __20 years later he was vindicated by [Maxwell’s
equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Maxwell)__ which we still use today.

At this point you might be thinking: “we are not scientists and software does not require the same level of
scientific rigor, as well, science.” Yet, the idea persists. Just because it originates within the hallowed
chambers of scientific achievement, it is not limited to them. Much of what we do today is owed to the same
principles. [Gödel’s incompleteness theorems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del), the [Church-Turing
thesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis); the list goes on. 

So this is now more important than ever when considered in the context of day-to-day perception and decision
making in our “distributed by default” style of communication on the Internet. If we accept that the
[medium is the vessel](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/charlie-robbins/2014-april-3), then by definition
one is constantly forming opinions based on the emotionally skewed communication of opinions from those we
choose to follow. 

The very idea of “following” as it is used today indeed itself suggests this bias that is taken for
granted and accepted as fact. Then shouldn’t this acceptance of bias as fact, or put more bluntly, this
[“Death of Expertise”](http://thefederalist.com/2014/01/17/the-death-of-expertise/) leave us all in our
own version of the dark ages? *It very well could,* but to embrace intellectual honesty is to do one’s part
to prevent these disastrous scenarios:

>   
> Integrity demands that when a thing is proved wrong, you admit it is proved wrong. But that is not all.
> “Proved wrong” is very different from “looking peculiar.” Quantum theory looked extremely peculiar
> when it was started. It didn’t fit any of the preconceived ideas.     
> —[Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary
> Scientist](http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short)

Yet embracing intellectual honesty is more than integrity because if one constant holds true across any
community it is that there is no constant among the minds of its members. This means that you will have to
deal with those who will doubt you. Who will disagree with you. Who will [call your ideas
cancer.](http://pages.citebite.com/b2x0j8q1megb) 

>   
> A person who is to live up to the highest ideas of scientific integrity cannot be led aside by the fact that a
> piece of work fits the latest style, that everybody’s doing it. They’ve got to be willing to follow it
> out, even if it doesn’t fit the latest style, if it fits their idea of how the field ought to develop.  
>  
> —[Intellectual Honesty and the Contemporary
> Scientist](http://abs.sagepub.com/content/8/3/15.short)

This is what is meant by *“Intellectual honesty and the dissenting idea”.* Dissent is good. Dissent is
necessary. Dissent is what moves the needle of humanity. Dissent tempered with honesty and experience mind
you, mindless zealots need not apply. And don’t forget to leave your personal attacks at home with the rest
of your emotional baggage.

And how does one acquire the experience to know the difference? To navigate between what is impartial and what
is personal? That’s the best part of intellectual honesty: if you are unsure of something you can go have a
rational, civil, and unbiased conversation with anyone and everyone in your peer group. And you know that your
peer group is not lying to you or to the public. 

So today try it out: accept intellectual honesty into your heart for just a little while. We all have biases;
so view what is obviously and inherently biased as biased. Not as intellectual fact.
