In 2001, I was writing my master’s thesis on Sesame Street, and Dr. Pat Washburn — the chair of my faculty
committee — told me I should call the program's founders. 

Seriously? That caliber of person would NEVER have the time to actually help a grad student in Meigs County,
Ohio. 

Try anyway.

So a few weeks later, I actually got the nerve to call [Lloyd
Morrisett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Morrisett). He created Sesame Street with Joan Ganz
Cooney. 

When I dialed Lloyd’s number — which I found online in the white pages — I was in a hotel room in East
Lansing, Mich. I had been there to support my former teammates on Ohio University’s swimming and diving
team; they were at Eastern Michigan U for the MAC championship meet.

It was a Saturday morning around 10 AM, and my mom had joined me — but she was out for a walk.

So I took advantage of the window of privacy to pick up the phone and dial Lloyd’s number.

Looking back, it was a completely random time to make this phone call. But I felt a surge of courage in that
exact random moment, so I went with it.

A woman answered. I asked if Lloyd was there. She said yes, then covered the mouthpiece to let Lloyd know the
call was for him.

For the next 10 seconds, I immediately started bead sweating. Actual beads of sweat on my head. My heart was
going bananas. I hadn’t prepared for the number to actually be correct, let alone that I might reach
him.

So when he got on the line and said, “Hello,” I asked, “Is this Lloyd Morrisett?”

“Yes it is,” he said.

Unconvinced, I said, “The Lloyd Morrisett who created Sesame Street?”

“Yes,” he repeated.

My mind raced. Holy cow, now what do I say?

Well, I turned into a babbling idiot, choking out some stream of drivel that included words like “Wow” and
“I grew up watching” and “really an honor.”

PULL IT TOGETHER, HAY.

Lloyd saying, “Can I help you with something, Miss…” brought me back to reality. I am a researcher
calling to inquire about Sesame Street’s early days of planning. I have actual, substantive questions to
ask.

Fortunately, I got them out in time to prove my worth, thanked him for his time and answers, and asked if I
could follow-up by email with more questions as-needed. He obliged.

Over the next year, he gave me transcripts of initial planning discussions among Sesame Street’s educational
experts, counselors, and creative folks … stuff that had never been cited before. I won awards for my
research because of his help.

Nearly 13 years later, Lloyd is among my closest friends. We Skype most every week. He helps me navigate the
up’s and down’s of jobs, relationships, and life’s uncertainties. We exchange health and fitness
stories. He even recorded himself joking around about me in this
video: [http://vimeo.com/46041723](http://vimeo.com/46041723)

For a long time I wondered why he keeps talking to me, especially because he’s very wise and I’m very
awkward. So I asked him one day, and he said that he was impressed by the questions I asked on that first
call. Then I kept asking substantive questions, so he kept answering them.

Beyond that, we just became friends like anybody becomes friends — with consistency, laughter, honesty, and
support. It just so happens that he created an exceptionally successful educational program beloved by
children and parents worldwide, and I wrote about how it became part of our culture.

I still think about how I first dismissed the idea of picking up the phone and calling. I would have missed
out on this friendship. I’m glad I tried anyway.
