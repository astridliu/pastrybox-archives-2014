It had been five years since I’d been home to celebrate Christmas with my family. 

After an 8-hour drive from DC, Matt and I rang the doorbell of my childhood home in Tiffin, Ohio. 

My mom answered and subsequently shouted “OH MY GOD!” over and over. 

I don’t think a hug from my dad ever felt so perfect.

In those rare moments, the furthest thing from my mind is what’s often at the forefront of my mind on a
daily basis.
