       <p>I think I’m just going to talk about content all year. And why shouldn’t I? I love it. But, when was the last time I showed that I love it? Not so much as a tweet since I wrote <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/orbital-content">Orbital Content</a> in 2011. How hard is it to pick up a tweet? So, for the next eleven pastries, I’ll be handing out tidbits about content that have occupied my mind over the last few years. Expect to maybe hear about: </p><ul><li>What does content ownership mean these days?</li><li>How can advertising adjust to meet the new way content is liberated and passed around?</li><li>What role does content play in the building of web products?</li><li>Speaking in interfaces vs. Speaking in content.</li><li>When does an experience become content? And how should that be preserved?</li><li>More Orbital Content </li><li>Apps come and go. Users are here to stay. What happens to their content in the long run?</li><li>Managing user expectations of content on your service</li><li>Stuff</li></ul><p>Should be a good time. If you’re looking for a little more meat in the meantime, check out <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy">Erin’s book on content strategy</a> (particularly the first half) or muscle through Orbital Content to get a sense of where I’m coming from.</p><hr /><p>Now that we got that out of the way, can we please talk about Downton Abbey (old news for the Brits)? Specifically, the “incident.” What in the name of all that is prim were the writers thinking? I know actors are leaving left and right, so new story lines are needed, but this one feels a bit lazy. Have you forgotten why people watch this show? I guarantee you it is not to head to bed anxiety-riddled after a surprise “incident” scene.</p><p>Anyhow, I’m grumpy. I had to chase my Downton with a shot of Bob’s Burgers, so I could hit the pillow with any chance of getting some sleep. We’ll see how they handle it, but I’m guessing it involves more Mr. “Martyr 4 Lyfe” Bates than I care to listen to.</p>
