As an industry, if you watch our own trends, it’s evident that we are constantly trying to find that fine
balance between the two polar opposites utility and gratuitousness. In the far corner, we have everyone’s
favorite Skip Intro, while in the other the memory of Jakob Nielsen’s 18px blue underlined links
forever. 

Don’t forget about delight. Delight can be found in a variety of ways — from making the experience a joy
to use, to creating something visually stunning and unexpected. It is the moment when someone makes a
connection to what you are presenting them, where pleasure is found and lost and rediscovered. It is when you
see someone say “oh” — where understanding and pleasure are equally coupled. Usability doesn’t need to
be synonymous with boring. 

Things need to be simple. Yes. They need to be usable. Definitely. But they also need to be delightful,
because an experience bereft of pleasure is one most don’t choose to have more than once. 

I like my ice cream vanilla, not my experiences.
